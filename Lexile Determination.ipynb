But it was not the fact that his toes\\nwere nearly out and his clothes dilapidated which brought the wrinkles\\nto his forehead and the tears to his eyes, for he was used to that\\nstate of things, and bore it without complaint. The prospect was a dull\\none for a lively lad full of the spring longings which sunny April\\nweather always brings. But it was not the narrow back-street where noisy\\nchildren played and two or three dusty trees tried to bud without\\nsunshine, that made him look so dismal. Nor was it the knowledge that a\\npile of vests was nearly ready for him to trudge away with before he\\ncould really rest after doing many errands to save mother\\'s weary feet.\\n\\nNo, it was a burden that lay very heavily on his heart, and made it\\nimpossible to even whistle as he waited. Above the sounds that filled\\nthe street he heard a patient moan from the room within; and no matter\\nwhat object his eyes rested on, he saw with sorrowful distinctness a\\nsmall white face turned wistfully toward the window, as if weary of the\\npillow where it had laid so long.\\n\\nMerry little Kitty, who used to sing and dance from morning till night,\\nwas now so feeble and wasted that he could carry her about like a baby.\\nAll day she lay moaning softly, and her one comfort was when \"brother\"\\ncould come and sing to her. That night he could not sing; his heart was\\nso full, because the doctor had said that the poor child must have\\ncountry air as soon as possible, else she never would recover from the\\nfever which left her such a sad little ghost of her former self. But,\\nalas, there was no money for the trip, and mother was sewing day and\\nnight to earn enough for a week at least of blessed country air and\\nquiet. Jimmy did his best to help, but could find very little to do, and\\nthe pennies came in so slowly he was almost in despair.\\n\\nThere was no father to lend a strong hand, and Mrs. Nelson was one of\\nthe \"silent poor,\" who cannot ask for charity, no matter how much they\\nmay need it. The twelve-year-old boy considered himself the man of the\\nfamily, and manfully carried as many burdens as his young shoulders\\nwould bear; but this was a very heavy one, so it is no wonder that he\\nlooked sober. Holding his curly head in his hands, as if to keep it from\\nflying asunder with the various plans working inside, he sat staring at\\nthe dusty bricks in a desperate frame of mind.\\n\\nWarm days were coming, and every hour was precious, for poor Kitty pined\\nin the close room, and all he could do was to bring her dandelions and\\nbits of green grass from the Common when she begged to go in the fields\\nand pick \"pretties\" for herself. He loved the little sister dearly,\\nand, as he remembered her longing, his eyes filled, and he doubled up\\nboth fists with an air of determination, muttering to himself,--\\n\\n\"She _shall_ go! I don\\'t see any other way, and I\\'ll do it!\"\\n\\nThe plan which had been uppermost lately was this. His father had been a\\nsailor, and Jimmy proposed to run away to sea as cabin boy. His wages\\nwere to be paid before he went, so mother and Kitty could be in the\\ncountry while he was gone, and in a few months he would come sailing\\ngayly home to find the child her rosy self again. A very boyish and\\nimpossible plan, but he meant it, and was in just the mood to carry it\\nout,--for every other attempt to make money had failed.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll do it as sure as my name is Jim Nelson. I\\'ll take a look at the\\nships this very night, and go in the first one that will have me,\" he\\nsaid, with a resolute nod of the head, though his heart sank within him\\nat the thought. \"I wonder which kind of captains pay boys best? I guess\\nI\\'ll try a steamer; they make short trips. I heard the cannon to-day, so\\none is in, and I\\'ll try for a place before I go to bed.\"\\n\\nLittle did desperate Jimmy guess what ship he would really sail in, nor\\nwhat a prosperous voyage he was about to make; for help was coming that\\nvery minute, as it generally does, sooner or later, to generous people\\nwho are very much in earnest.\\n\\nFirst a shrill whistle was heard, at the sound of which he looked up\\nquickly; then a rosy-faced girl of about his own age came skipping down\\nthe street, swinging her hat by one string; and, as Jimmy watched her\\napproach, a smile began to soften the grim look he wore, for Willy\\nBryant was his best friend and neighbor, being full of courage, fun, and\\nkindness. He nodded, and made room for her on the step,--the place she\\nusually occupied at spare moments when they got lessons and recounted\\ntheir scrapes to each other.\\n\\nBut to-night Willy seemed possessed of some unusually good piece of news\\nwhich she chose to tell in her own lively fashion, for, instead of\\nsitting down, she began to dance a sailor\\'s hornpipe, singing gayly,\\n\"I\\'m little Buttercup, sweet little Buttercup,\" till her breath gave\\nout.\\n\\n\"What makes you so jolly, Will?\" asked Jimmy, as she dropped down\\nbeside him and fanned herself with the ill-used hat.\\n\\n\"Such fun--you\\'ll never guess--just what we wanted--if your mother only\\nwill! You\\'ll dance, too, when you know,\" panted the girl, smiling like a\\nsubstantial sort of fairy come to bring good luck.\\n\\n\"Fire away, then. It will have to be extra nice to set me off. I don\\'t\\nfeel a bit like jigs now,\" answered Jimmy, as the gloom obscured his\\nface again, like a cloud over the sun.\\n\\n\"You know \\'Pinafore\\'?\" began Will, and getting a quick nod for an\\nanswer, she poured forth the following tale with great rapidity: \"Well,\\nsome folks are going to get it up with children to do it, and they want\\nany boys and girls that can sing to go and be looked at to-morrow, and\\nthe good ones will be picked out, and dressed up, and taught how to act,\\nand have the nicest time that ever was. Some of our girls are going, and\\nso am I, and you sing and must come, too, and have some fun. Won\\'t it be\\njolly?\"\\n\\n\"I guess it would; but I can\\'t. Mother needs me every minute out of\\nschool,\" began Jimmy, with a shake of the head, having made up his mind\\nsome time ago that he must learn to do without fun.\\n\\n\"But we shall be paid for it,\" cried Will, clapping her hands with the\\ndouble delight of telling the best part of her story, and seeing Jimmy\\'s\\nsober face clear suddenly as if the sun had burst forth with great\\nbrilliancy.\\n\\n\"Really? How much? Can I sing well enough?\" and he clutched her arm\\nexcitedly, for this unexpected ray of hope dazzled him.\\n\\n\"Some of them will have ten dollars a week, and some more,--the real\\nnice ones, like Lee, the singing boy, who is a wonder,\" answered Will,\\nin the tone of one well informed on such points.\\n\\n\"Ten dollars!\" gasped Jimmy, for the immensity of the sum took his\\nbreath away. \"Could _I_ get that? How long? Where do we go? Do they\\nreally want us fellows? Are you sure it\\'s all true?\"\\n\\n\"It was all in the paper, and Miss Pym, the teacher who boards at our\\nhouse, told Ma about it. The folks advertised for school-children, sixty\\nof \\'em, and will really pay; and Ma said I could go and try, and all\\nthe money I get I\\'m going to put in a bank and have for my own. Don\\'t\\nyou believe me now?\"\\n\\nMiss Pym and the newspapers settled the matter in Jimmy\\'s mind, and made\\nhim more anxious than before about the other point.\\n\\n\"Do you think _I_ would have any chance?\" he asked, still holding Will,\\nwho seemed inclined for another dance.\\n\\n\"I know you would. Don\\'t you do splendidly at school? And didn\\'t they\\nwant you for a choir boy, only your mother couldn\\'t spare you?\" answered\\nWill, decidedly; for Jimmy did love music, and had a sweet little pipe\\nof his own, as she well knew.\\n\\n\"Mother will have to spare me now, if they pay like that. I can work all\\nday and do without sleep to earn money this way. Oh, Will, I\\'m so glad\\nyou came, for I was just ready to run away to sea. There didn\\'t seem\\nanything else to do,\" whispered Jimmy in a choky sort of tone, as hopes\\nand fears struggled together in his boyish mind.\\n\\n\"Run as fast as you like, and I\\'ll go too. We\\'ll sail in the \\'Pinafore,\\'\\nand come home with our pockets full of money.\\n\\n\"\\'Sing, hey, the merry maiden and the tar!\\'\"\\n\\nburst out Will, who was so full of spirits she could not keep still\\nanother minute.\\n\\nJimmy joined in, and the fresh voices echoed through the street so\\npleasantly that Mrs. Peters stopped scolding her six squabbling\\nchildren, while Kitty\\'s moaning changed to a feeble little sound of\\nsatisfaction, for \"brother\\'s\" lullabies were her chief comfort and\\ndelight.\\n\\n\"We shall lose school, you know, for we act in the afternoon, not the\\nevening. I don\\'t care; but you will, you like to study so well. Miss Pym\\ndidn\\'t like it at first, but Ma said it would help the poor folks, and a\\nlittle fun wouldn\\'t hurt the children. I thought of you right away, and\\nif you don\\'t get as much money as I do, you shall have some of mine, so\\nKitty can go away soon.\"\\n\\nWill\\'s merry face grew very sweet and kind as she said that, and Jimmy\\nwas glad his mother called him just then, because he did not know how\\nto thank this friend in need. When he came out with the parcel of vests\\nhe looked like a different boy, for Mrs. Nelson had told him to go and\\nfind out all about it, and had seemed as much dazzled by the prospect as\\nhe did, sewing was such weary work.\\n\\nTheir interview with Miss Pym was a most encouraging one, and it was\\nsoon settled that Jimmy should go with Will to try for a place on the\\nmorrow.\\n\\n\"And I\\'ll get it, too!\" he said to himself, as he kissed Kitty\\'s thin\\ncheek, full of the sweet hope that he might be the means of bringing\\nback life and color to the little face he loved so well.\\n\\nHe was so excited he could not sleep, and beguiled the long hours by\\nhumming under his breath all the airs he knew belonging to the already\\npopular opera. Next morning he flew about his work as if for a wager,\\nand when Will came for him there was not a happier heart in all the city\\nthan the hopeful one that thumped under Jimmy\\'s threadbare best jacket.\\n\\nSuch a crowd of girls and boys as they found at the hall where they\\nwere told to apply for inspection; such a chirping and piping went on\\nthere, it sounded like a big cage full of larks and linnets; and by and\\nby, when the trial was over, such a smiling troop of children as was\\nleft to be drilled by the energetic gentlemen who had the matter in\\nhand. Among this happy band stood our Jimmy, chosen for his good voice,\\nand Will, because of her bright face and lively, self-possessed manners.\\nThey could hardly wait to be dismissed, and it was a race home to see\\nwho should be first to tell the good news. Jimmy tried to be quiet on\\nKitty\\'s account, but failed entirely; and it was a pleasant sight to see\\nthe boy run into his mother\\'s arms, crying joyfully,--\\n\\n\"I\\'m in! I\\'m in! Ten dollars a week! Hurrah!\"\\n\\n\"I can hardly believe it!\" And weary Mrs. Nelson dropped her needle to\\nindulge in a few moments of delightful repose.\\n\\n\"If it goes well they may want us for a month or six weeks,\" the man\\nsaid. \"Just think, maybe I\\'ll get fifty or sixty dollars! and Baby will\\nget well right off,\" cried Jimmy, in an arithmetical sort of rapture,\\nas he leaned above Kitty, who tried to clap her little hands without\\nquite knowing what the joy was all about.\\n\\n\\nHOW HE SAILED.\\n\\nAfter that day Jimmy led a very happy life, for he loved music and\\nenjoyed the daily drill with his mates, though it was long before he saw\\nthe inside of the theatre. Will knew a good deal about it, for an\\nactor\\'s family had boarded with her mother, and the little girl had been\\nbehind the scenes. But to Jimmy, who had only seen one fairy play, all\\nwas very strange when at last he went upon the stage; for the glittering\\nworld he expected was gone, and all was dusty, dark, and queer, with\\ntrap-doors underfoot, machinery overhead, and a wilderness of scenery\\njumbled together in the drollest way. He was all eyes and ears, and\\nenjoyed himself immensely as he came and went, sung and acted, with the\\ntroop of lads who made up the sailor chorus. It was a real ship to him,\\nin spite of painted cannon, shaky masts, and cabin doors that led\\nnowhere. He longed to run up the rigging; but as that was forbidden,\\nfor fear of danger, he contented himself by obeying orders with nautical\\nobedience, singing with all his might, and taking great satisfaction in\\nhis blue suit with the magical letters \"H. M. S. Pinafore\" round his\\ncap.\\n\\nDay by day all grew more and more interesting. His mother was never\\ntired of hearing his adventures, he sung Kitty to sleep with the new\\nsongs, and the neighbors took such a friendly interest in his success\\nthat they called him Lord Nelson, and predicted that he would be as\\nfamous as his great namesake.\\n\\nWhen the grand day came at last, and the crew of jolly young tars stood\\nready to burst forth with the opening chorus,\\n\\n\"We sail the ocean blue,\\n  Our saucy ship\\'s a beauty;\\nWe\\'re gallant men and true,\\n  And bound to do our duty!\"\\n\\nJimmy hardly knew whether he stood on his head or his heels at first,\\nfor, in spite of many rehearsals, everything seemed changed. Instead of\\ndaylight, gas shone everywhere, the empty seats were full, the\\norchestra playing splendidly, and when the curtain rose, a sea of\\nfriendly faces welcomed them, and the pleasant sound of applause made\\nthe hearts under the blue jackets dance gayly.\\n\\nHow those boys did sing! how their eyes shone, and their feet kept time\\nto the familiar strains! with what a relish they hitched up their\\ntrousers and lurched about, or saluted and cheered as the play demanded.\\nWith what interest they watched the microscopic midshipmite, listened to\\nRafe as his sweet voice melodiously told the story of his hapless love,\\nand smiled on pretty Josephine, who was a regular bluebird without the\\nscream.\\n\\n\"Ain\\'t this fun?\" whispered Jimmy\\'s next neighbor, taking advantage of a\\ngeneral burst of laughter, as the inimitable little bumboat woman\\nadvertised her wares with captivating drollery.\\n\\n\"Right down jolly!\" answered Jimmy, feeling that a series of somersaults\\nacross the stage would be an immense relief to the pent-up emotions of\\nhis boyish soul. For under all the natural excitement of the hour deep\\ndown lay the sweet certainty that he was earning health for Kitty, and\\nit made his heart sing for joy more blithely than any jovial chorus to\\nwhich he lent his happy voice.\\n\\nBut his bliss was not complete till the stately Sir Joseph, K. C. B.,\\nhad come aboard, followed by \"his sisters and his cousins and his\\naunts;\" for among that flock of devoted relatives in white muslin and\\ngay ribbons was Will. Standing in the front row, her bright face was\\ngood to see, for her black eyes sparkled, every hair on her head curled\\nits best, her cherry bows streamed in the breeze, and her feet pranced\\nirresistibly at the lively parts of the music. She longed to dance the\\nhornpipe which the little Quaker aunt did so capitally, but, being\\ndenied that honor, distinguished herself by the comic vigor with which\\nshe \"polished up the handle of the big front door,\" and did the other\\n\"business\" recorded by the gallant \"ruler of the Queen\\'s Navee.\"\\n\\nShe and Jimmy nodded to each other behind the Admiral\\'s august back, and\\nwhile Captain Corcoran was singing to the moon, and Buttercup suffering\\nthe pangs of \"Wemorse,\" the young people had a gay time behind the\\nscenes. Jimmy and Will sat upon a green baize bank to compare notes,\\nwhile the relatives flew about like butterflies, and the sailors talked\\nbase-ball, jack-knives, and other congenial topics, when not envying Sir\\nJoseph his cocked hat, and the Captain his epaulettes.\\n\\nIt was a very successful launch, and the merry little crew set sail with\\na fair wind and every prospect of a prosperous voyage. When the first\\nperformance was over, our two children left their fine feathers behind\\nthem, like Cinderella when the magic hour struck, and went gayly home,\\nfeeling much elated, for they knew they should go back to fresh\\ntriumphs, and were earning money by their voices like Jenny Lind and\\nMario. How they pitied other boys and girls who could not go in at that\\nmysterious little door; how important they felt as parts of the\\nspectacle about which every one was talking, and what millionnaires they\\nconsidered themselves as they discussed their earnings and planned what\\nto do with the prospective fortunes.\\n\\nThat was the beginning of many busy, happy weeks for both the\\nchildren,--weeks which they long remembered with great pleasure, as did\\nolder and wiser people; for that merry, innocent little opera proved\\nthat theatres can be made the scenes of harmless amusement, and opened\\nto a certain class of young people a new and profitable field for their\\ntalents. So popular did this small company become that the piece went on\\nthrough the summer vacation, and was played in the morning as well as\\nafternoon to satisfy the crowds who wished to see and hear it.\\n\\nNever had the dear old Boston Museum, which so many of us have loved and\\nhaunted for years, seen such a pretty sight as one of those morning\\nperformances. It was the perfection of harmless merry-making, and the\\naudience was as pleasant a spectacle as that upon the stage. Fathers and\\nmothers stole an hour from their busy lives to come and be children with\\ntheir children, irresistibly attracted and charmed by the innocent fun,\\nthe gay music that bewitched the ear one could hardly tell why, and the\\nartless acting of those who are always playing parts, whether the\\nnursery or the theatre is their stage.\\n\\nThe windows stood open, and sunshine and fresh air came in to join the\\nrevel. Babies crowed and prattled, mammas chatted together, old people\\nfound they had not forgotten how to laugh, and boys and girls rejoiced\\nover the discovery of a new delight for holidays. It was good to be\\nthere, and in spite of all the discussion in papers and parlors, no harm\\ncame to the young mariners, but much careful training of various sorts,\\nand well-earned wages that went into pockets which sorely needed a\\nsilver lining.\\n\\n\\nHOW THE VOYAGE ENDED.\\n\\nSo the good ship \"Pinafore\" sailed and sailed for many prosperous weeks,\\nand when at last she came into port and dropped anchor for the season\\nshe was received with a salute of general approbation for the successful\\nengagement out of which she came with her flags flying and not one of\\nher gallant crew killed or wounded. Well pleased with their share of the\\nglory, officers and men went ashore to spend their prize money with\\ntrue sailor generosity, all eager to ship again for another cruise in\\nthe autumn.\\n\\nBut long before that time Able Seaman James Nelson had sent his family\\ninto the country, mother begging Will to take good care of her dear boy\\ntill he could join them, and Kitty throwing kisses as she smiled\\ngood-by, with cheeks already the rosier for the comforts \"brother\" had\\nearned for her. Jimmy would not desert his ship while she floated, but\\nmanaged to spend his Sundays out of town, often taking Will with him as\\nfirst mate; and, thanks to her lively tongue, friends were soon made for\\nthe new-comers. Mrs. Nelson found plenty of sewing, Kitty grew strong\\nand well in the fine air, and the farmer with whom they lived, seeing\\nwhat a handy lad the boy was, offered him work and wages for the autumn,\\nso all could be independent and together. With this comfortable prospect\\nbefore him, Jimmy sang away like a contented blackbird, never tiring of\\nhis duty, for he was a general favorite, and Kitty literally strewed his\\nway with flowers gathered by her own grateful little hands.\\n\\nWhen the last day came, he was in such spirits that he was found doing\\ndouble-shuffles in corners, hugging the midshipmite, who was a little\\ngirl of about Kitty\\'s age, and treating his messmates to peanuts with a\\nlavish hand. Will had her hornpipe, also, when the curtain was down,\\nkissed every one of the other \"sisters, cousins, and aunts,\" and joined\\nlustily in the rousing farewell cheers given by the crew.\\n\\nA few hours later, a cheerful-looking boy might have been seen trudging\\ntoward one of the railway-stations. A new hat, brave in blue streamers,\\nwas on his head; a red balloon struggled to escape from one hand; a\\nshabby carpet-bag, stuffed full, was in the other; and a pair of shiny\\nshoes creaked briskly, as if the feet inside were going on a very\\npleasant errand.\\n\\nAbout this young traveller, who walked with a sailor-like roll and\\nlurch, revolved a little girl chattering like a magpie, and occasionally\\nbreaking into song, as if she couldn\\'t help it.\\n\\n\"Be sure you come next Saturday; it won\\'t be half such fun if you don\\'t\\ngo halves,\" said the boy, beaming at her as he hauled down the\\nimpatient balloon, which seemed inclined to break from its moorings\\n\\n\"\\'Yes, I know\\nThat is so!\\'\"\\n\\nhummed the girl with a skip to starboard, that she might bear a hand\\nwith the bag. \"Keep some cherries for me, and don\\'t forget to give Kit\\nthe doll I dressed for her.\"\\n\\n\"I shouldn\\'t have been going myself if it hadn\\'t been for you, Will. I\\nnever shall forget that,\" said Jimmy, whom intense satisfaction rendered\\nrather more sedate than his friend.\\n\\n\"Running away to sea is great fun,\\n\\n\\'With a tar that ploughs the water!\\'\"\\n\\nsung Will in spite of herself.\\n\\n\"\\'And a gallant captain\\'s daughter,\\'\"\\n\\nechoed Jimmy, smiling across the carpet-bag. Then both joined in an\\nirrepressible chorus of \"Dash it! Dash it!\" as a big man nearly upset\\nthem and a dog barked madly at the balloon.\\n\\nBeing safely landed in the train, Jimmy hung out of the window till the\\nlast minute, discussing his new prospects with Will, who stood on tiptoe\\noutside, bubbling over with fun.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll teach you to make butter and cheese, and you shall be my\\ndairy-woman, for I mean to be a farmer,\" he said, just as the bell rang.\\n\\n\"All right, I\\'d like that ever so much.\" And then the irrepressible\\nmadcap burst out, to the great amusement of the passengers,--\\n\\n\"\\'For you might have been a Roosian,\\nA Frenchman, Turk or Proosian,\\n        Or an Ital-i-an.\\'\"\\n\\nAnd Jimmy could not resist shouting back, as the train began to move,--\\n\\n\"\\'But in spite of all temptations\\nTo belong to other nations,\\n    I\\'m an Amer-i-can.\\'\"\\n\\nThen he subsided, to think over the happy holiday before him and the\\nrich cargo of comfort, independence, and pleasure he had brought home\\nfrom his successful cruise in the \"Pinafore.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII.\\n\\nTWO LITTLE TRAVELLERS.\\n\\n\\nThe first of these true histories is about Annie Percival,--a very dear\\nand lovely child, whose journey interested many other children, and is\\nstill remembered with gratitude by those whom she visited on a far-off\\nisland.\\n\\nAnnie was six when she sailed away to Fayal with her mother, grandmamma,\\nand \"little Aunt Ruth,\" as she called the young aunty who was still a\\nschool-girl. Very cunning was Annie\\'s outfit, and her little trunk was a\\npretty as well as a curious sight, for everything was so small and\\ncomplete it looked as if a doll was setting off for Europe. Such a wee\\ndressing-case, with bits of combs and brushes for the curly head; such a\\ncosey scarlet wrapper for the small woman to wear in her berth, with\\nslippers to match when she trotted from state-room to state-room; such\\npiles of tiny garments laid nicely in, and the owner\\'s initials on the\\noutside of the trunk; not to mention the key on a ribbon in her pocket,\\nas grown up as you please.\\n\\nI think the sight of that earnest, sunshiny face must have been very\\npleasant to all on board, no matter how seasick they might be, and the\\nsound of the cheery little voice, as sweet as the chirp of a bird,\\nespecially when she sung the funny song about the \"Owl and the pussy-cat\\nin the pea-green boat,\" for she had charming ways, and was always making\\nquaint, wise, or loving remarks.\\n\\nWell, \"they sailed and they sailed,\" and came at last to Fayal, where\\neverything was so new and strange that Annie\\'s big brown eyes could\\nhardly spare time to sleep, so busy were they looking about. The donkeys\\namused her very much, so did the queer language and ways of the\\nPortuguese people round her, especially the very droll names given to\\nthe hens of a young friend. The biddies seemed to speak the same dialect\\nas at home, but evidently they understood Spanish also, and knew their\\nown names, so it was fun to go and call Rio, Pico, Cappy, Clarissa,\\nWhorfie, and poor Simonena, whose breast-bone grew out so that she\\ncould not eat and had to be killed.\\n\\nBut the thing which made the deepest impression on Annie was a visit to\\na charity-school at the old convent of San Antonio. It was kept by some\\nkind ladies, and twenty-five girls were taught and cared for in the big,\\nbare place, that looked rather gloomy and forlorn to people from happy\\nBoston, where charitable institutions are on a noble scale, as everybody\\nknows.\\n\\nAnnie watched all that went on with intelligent interest, and when they\\nwere shown into the play-room she was much amazed and afflicted to find\\nthat the children had nothing to play with but a heap of rags, out of\\nwhich they made queer dolls, with ravelled twine for hair, faces rudely\\ndrawn on the cloth, and funny boots on the shapeless legs. No other toys\\nappeared, but the girls sat on the floor of the great stone room,--for\\nthere was no furniture,--playing contentedly with their poor dolls, and\\nsmiling and nodding at \"the little Americana,\" who gravely regarded this\\nsad spectacle, wondering how they could get on without china and waxen\\nbabies, tea-sets, and pretty chairs and tables to keep house with.\\n\\nThe girls thought that she envied them their dolls, and presently one\\ncame shyly up to offer two of their best, leaving the teacher to explain\\nin English their wish to be polite to their distinguished guest. Like\\nthe little gentlewoman she was, Annie graciously accepted the ugly bits\\nof rag with answering nods and smiles, and carried them away with her as\\ncarefully as if they were of great beauty and value.\\n\\nBut when she was at home she expressed much concern and distress at the\\ndestitute condition of the children. Nothing but rags to play with\\nseemed a peculiarly touching state of poverty to her childish mind, and\\nbeing a generous creature she yearned to give of her abundance to \"all\\nthe poor orphans who didn\\'t have any nice dollies.\" She had several pets\\nof her own, but not enough to go round even if she sacrificed them, so\\nkind grandmamma, who had been doing things of this sort all her life,\\nrelieved the child\\'s perplexity by promising to send twenty-five fine\\ndolls to Fayal as soon as the party returned to Boston, where these\\nnecessaries of child-life are cheap and plenty.\\n\\nThus comforted, Annie felt that she could enjoy her dear Horta and Chica\\nPico Fatiera, particular darlings rechristened since her arrival. A\\nbundle of gay bits of silk, cloth, and flannel, and a present of money\\nfor books, were sent out to the convent by the ladies. A treat of little\\ncheeses for the girls to eat with their dry bread was added, much to\\nAnnie\\'s satisfaction, and helped to keep alive her interest in the\\nschool of San Antonio.\\n\\nAfter many pleasant adventures during the six months spent in the city,\\nour party came sailing home again all the better for the trip, and Annie\\nso full of tales to tell that it was a never-failing source of amusement\\nto hear her hold forth to her younger brother in her pretty way,\\n\"splaining and \\'scribing all about it.\"\\n\\nGrandmamma\\'s promise was faithfully kept, and Annie brooded blissfully\\nover the twenty-five dolls till they were dressed, packed, and sent away\\nto Fayal. A letter of thanks soon came back from the teacher, telling\\nhow surprised and delighted the girls were, and how they talked of\\nAnnie as if she were a sort of fairy princess who in return for two poor\\nrag-babies sent a miraculous shower of splendid china ladies with gay\\ngowns and smiling faces.\\n\\nThis childish charity was made memorable to all who knew of it by the\\nfact that three months after she came home from that happy voyage Annie\\ntook the one from which there is no return. For this journey there was\\nneeded no preparation but a little white gown, a coverlet of flowers,\\nand the casket where the treasure of many hearts was tenderly laid away.\\nAll alone, but not afraid, little Annie crossed the unknown sea that\\nrolls between our world and the Islands of the Blest, to be welcomed\\nthere, I am sure, by spirits as innocent as her own, leaving behind her\\na very precious memory of her budding virtues and the relics of a short,\\nsweet life.\\n\\nEvery one mourned for her, and all her small treasures were so carefully\\nkept that they still exist. Poor Horta, in the pincushion arm-chair,\\nseems waiting patiently for the little mamma to come again; the two\\nrag-dolls lie side by side in grandma\\'s scrap-book, since there is now\\nno happy voice to wake them into life; and far away in the convent of\\nSan Antonio the orphans carefully keep their pretty gifts in memory of\\nthe sweet giver. To them she is a saint now, not a fairy princess; for\\nwhen they heard of her death they asked if they might pray for the soul\\nof the dear little Americana, and the teacher said, \"Pray rather for the\\npoor mother who has lost so much.\" So the grateful orphans prayed and\\nthe mother was comforted, for now another little daughter lies in her\\narms and kisses away the lonely pain at her heart.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe second small traveller I want to tell about lived in the same city\\nas the first, and her name was Maggie Woods. Her father was an\\nEnglishman who came to America to try his fortune, but did not find it;\\nfor, when Maggie was three months old, the great Chicago fire destroyed\\ntheir home; soon after, the mother died; then the father was drowned,\\nand Maggie was left all alone in a strange country.\\n\\nShe had a good aunt in England, however, who took great pains to\\ndiscover the child after the death of the parents, and sent for her to\\ncome home and be cared for. It was no easy matter to get a five-years\\'\\nchild across the Atlantic, for the aunt could not come to fetch her, and\\nno one whom she knew was going over. But Maggie had found friends in\\nChicago; the American consul at Manchester was interested in the case,\\nand every one was glad to help the forlorn baby, who was too young to\\nunderstand the pathos of her story.\\n\\nAfter letters had gone to and fro, it was decided to send the child to\\nEngland in charge of the captain of a steamer, trusting to the kindness\\nof all fellow-travellers to help her on her way.\\n\\nThe friends in Chicago bestirred themselves to get her ready, and then\\nit was that Annie\\'s mother found that she could do something which would\\nhave delighted her darling, had she been here to know of it. Laid\\ntenderly away were many small garments belonging to the other little\\npilgrim, whose journeying was so soon ended; and from among all these\\nprecious things Mrs. Percival carefully chose a comfortable outfit for\\nthat cold March voyage.\\n\\nThe little gray gown went, and the red hood, the warm socks, and the\\ncosey wraps no longer needed by the quiet sleeper under the snow.\\nPerhaps something of her loving nature lingered about the clothes, and\\nhelped to keep the orphan warm and safe, for Annie\\'s great delight was\\nto pet and help all who needed comfort and protection.\\n\\nWhen all was ready, Maggie\\'s small effects were packed in a light\\nbasket, so that she could carry it herself if need be. A card briefly\\ntelling the story was fastened on the corner, and a similar paper\\nrecommending her to the protection of all kind people, was sewed to the\\nbosom of her frock. Then, not in the least realizing what lay before\\nher, the child was consigned to the conductor of the train to be\\nforwarded to persons in New York who would see her safely on board the\\nsteamer.\\n\\nI should dearly like to have seen the little maid and the big basket as\\nthey set out on that long trip as tranquilly as if for a day\\'s visit;\\nand it is a comfort to know that before the train started, the persons\\nwho took her there had interested a motherly lady in the young\\ntraveller, who promised to watch over her while their ways were the\\nsame.\\n\\nAll went well, and Maggie was safely delivered to the New York friends,\\nwho forwarded her to the steamer, well supplied with toys and comforts\\nfor the voyage, and placed in charge of captain and stewardess. She\\nsailed on the 3d of March, and on the 12th landed at Liverpool, after a\\npleasant trip, during which she was the pet of all on board.\\n\\nThe aunt welcomed her joyfully, and the same day the child reached her\\nnew home, the Commercial Inn, Compstall, after a journey of over four\\nthousand miles. The consul and owners of the steamer wanted to see the\\nadventurous young lady who had come so far alone, and neighbors and\\nstrangers made quite a lion of her, for all kindly hearts were\\ninterested, and the protective charity which had guided and guarded her\\nin two hemispheres and across the wide sea, made all men fathers, all\\nwomen mothers, to the little one till she was safe.\\n\\nHer picture lies before me as I write,--a pretty child standing in a\\nchair, with a basket of toys on the table before her; curly hair pushed\\nback from the face, pensive eyes, and a pair of stout little feet\\ncrossed one over the other as if glad to rest. I wish I could put the\\nphotograph into the story, because the small heroine is an interesting\\none, and still lives with the good aunt, who is very fond and proud of\\nher, and writes pleasant accounts of her progress to the friends in\\nAmerica.\\n\\nSo ends the journey of my second small traveller, and when I think of\\nher safe and happy in a good home, I always fancy that (if such things\\nmay be) in the land which is lovelier than even beautiful old England,\\nMaggie\\'s mother watches over little Annie.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIII.\\n\\nA JOLLY FOURTH.\\n\\n\\nDoor-step parties were the fashion that year, and it was while a dozen\\nyoung folks sat chatting on Annie Hadwin\\'s steps in the twilight that\\nthey laid the plan which turned out such a grand success in the end.\\n\\n\"For my part, I am glad we are to be put on a short allowance of\\ngunpowder, and that crackers are forbidden, they are such a nuisance,\\nburning holes in clothes, frightening horses, and setting houses afire,\"\\nsaid sober Fred from the gate, where he and several other fellows were\\nroosting socially together.\\n\\n\"It won\\'t seem a bit like a regular Fourth without the salutes three\\ntimes during the day. They are afraid the old cannon will kick, and blow\\noff some other fellow\\'s arm, as it did last year,\" added Elly Dickens,\\nthe beau of the party, as he pulled down his neat wristbands, hoping\\nMaud admired the new cuff-buttons in them.\\n\\n\"What shall we do in the evening, since the ball is given up? Just\\nbecause the old folks are too tired to enjoy dancing, we can\\'t have any,\\nand I think it is too bad,\" said pretty Belle, impatiently, for she\\ndanced like a fairy and was never tired.\\n\\n\"The authorities didn\\'t dare to stop our races in the morning. There\\nwould have been an insurrection if they had,\" called out long Herbert\\nfrom the grass, where he lay at the feet of black-eyed Julia.\\n\\n\"We _must_ do something to finish off with. Come, somebody suggest a\\nnew, nice, safe, and jolly plan for the evening,\" cried Grace, who liked\\nfun, and had just slipped a little toad into Jack Spratt\\'s pocket as a\\npleasant surprise when he felt for his handkerchief.\\n\\n\"Let us offer a prize for the brightest idea. Five minutes for\\nmeditation, then all suggest a plan, and the best one shall be adopted,\"\\nproposed Annie, glad to give a lively turn to her party.\\n\\nAll agreed, and sudden silence followed the chatter, broken now and\\nthen by an exclamation of \"I\\'ve got it! No, I haven\\'t,\" which produced a\\nlaugh at the impetuous party.\\n\\n\"Time\\'s up,\" announced Fred, looking at \"the turnip,\" as his big\\nold-fashioned watch was called. Every one had a proposal more or less\\noriginal, and much discussion followed; but it was finally decided that\\nHerbert\\'s idea of floating about in boats to enjoy the fireworks on the\\nhill would be romantic, reposeful, and on the whole satisfactory.\\n\\n\"Each boat might have a colored lantern; that would look pretty, and\\nthen there would be no danger of running into our neighbors in the\\ndark,\" said Annie, who was a little timid on the water in a wherry.\\n\\n\"Why not have lots, and make a regular \\'feast of lanterns,\\' as they do\\nin China? I was reading about it the other day, and can show you how to\\ndo it. Won\\'t it be gay?\" And Fred the bookworm nearly tumbled off his\\nperch, as an excited gesture emptied his pockets of the library books\\nwhich served as ballast.\\n\\n\"Yes! yes!\" cried the other lads, with various demonstrations of\\ndelight as the new fancy grew upon their lively minds.\\n\\n\"Fred and Annie must have the prize, for their idea is the most\\nbrilliant one. Nan can give the flag to the winner of the race, and\\n\\'Deacon\\' can lead the boats, for _I_ think it would be fine to have a\\nprocession on the river. Fireworks are an old story, so let us surprise\\nthe town by something regularly splendid,\" proposed Elly, fired in his\\nturn with a bright idea.\\n\\n\"We will! we will!\" cried the rest, and at once plunged into the affair\\nwith all the ardor of their years.\\n\\n\"Let us dress up,\" said Julia, who liked theatricals.\\n\\n\"In different characters,\" added Maud, thinking how well her long yellow\\nhair would look as a mermaid.\\n\\n\"And all sing as we go under the bridges,\" put in Annie, who adored\\nmusic.\\n\\n\"What a pity the boats can\\'t dance, it would be so lovely to see them\\nwaltzing round like fireflies!\" said Belle, still longing for the ball.\\n\\n\"A lot of fellows are coming up to spend the day with us, and we ought\\nto have some sort of a picnic; city folks think so much of such things,\"\\nsaid Herbert the hospitable, for his house and barn were the favorite\\nresorts of all his mates, and three gentle little sisters always came\\ninto his plans if possible.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve got two girl cousins coming, and they would like it, I guess. I\\nshould any way, for Jack will go tagging after Grace and leave me to\\ntake care of them. Let\\'s have a picnic, by all means,\" said lazy Fred,\\nwho thought all girls but one great plagues.\\n\\n\"I shouldn\\'t wonder if all our people liked that plan, and we might have\\na town picnic as we did once before. Let every one ask his or her\\nmother, and see if we can\\'t do it,\" suggested Annie, eager for a whole\\nday of merry-making.\\n\\nThe door-step party was late in breaking up that night; and if half the\\nplans proposed had been carried out, that town would have been\\nconsidered a large lunatic asylum. Wiser heads remodelled the wild\\nplans, however, and more skilful hands lent their aid, so that only the\\npossible was attempted, though the older folks had bright ideas as well\\nas the boys and girls, and gave the finishing touches to the affair.\\n\\nThe Fourth was a fine day, with a fresh air, cloudless sky, and no dust.\\nThe town was early astir, though neither sunrise cannon nor the Antiques\\nand Horribles disturbed the dawn with their clamor. The bells rang\\nmerrily, and at eight all flocked to the Town Hall to hear the\\nDeclaration of Independence read by the good and great man of the town,\\nwhose own wise and noble words go echoing round the world, teaching the\\nsame lesson of justice, truth, and courage as that immortal protest. An\\nOde by the master of the revels was sung, then every one shouted America\\nwith hearty good-will, and before the echoes had fairly died away, the\\ncrowd streamed forth to the river-side; for these energetic people were\\nbound to make a day of it.\\n\\nAt nine the races began, and both green banks of the stream were lined\\nwith gay groups eagerly watching \"our boys\" as they swept by in\\nwherries, paddled in canoes, or splashed and tumbled in and out of their\\ntubs amid shouts of laughter from the spectators. The older fellows did\\nthe scientific, and their prizes were duly awarded by the judges. But\\nour young party had their share of fun, and Fred and Herbert, who were\\nchums in everything, won the race for the little flag yearly given to\\nthe lads for any success on the river. Then the weary heroes loaded the\\nbig dory with a cargo of girls, and with the banner blowing gayly in the\\nwind, rowed away to the wide meadow, where seven oaks cast shade enough\\nto shelter a large picnic. And a large one they had, for the mammas took\\nkindly to the children\\'s suggestion, agreeing to club together in a\\nsocial lunch, each contributing her stores, her family, and her guests,\\nall being happy together in the free and easy way so pleasant and\\npossible in summer weather.\\n\\nA merry company they were, and it was a comfortable sight to see the\\ntired fathers lying in the shade, while the housewives forgot their\\ncares for a day, the young folks made table-setting and dishwashing a\\njoke by doing it together, and the children frolicked to their hearts\\'\\ncontent. Even the babies were trundled to the party by proud mammas and\\ntook naps in their carriages, or held receptions for admiring friends\\nand neighbors with infantile dignity.\\n\\nA social, sensible time, and when sunset came all turned homeward to\\nmake ready for the evening festivities. It was vaguely rumored that the\\npretty rustic bridge was to be illuminated, for the older people had\\ntaken up the idea and had _their_ surprises ready as well as the young\\nfolks. A band was stationed by the river-side, a pretty villa on the\\nhill blazed out with lines of light, and elms and apple-trees bore red\\nand golden lanterns, like glorified fruit. The clerk of the weather was\\nevidently interested in this novel entertainment, for the evening was\\nwindless, dark, and cool, so the arch of light that spanned the shadowy\\nriver shone splendidly. Fireworks soared up from the hill-top beyond,\\nfireflies lent their dancing sparks to illuminate the meadows, and the\\nthree bridges were laden with the crowds, who greeted each new surprise\\nwith cries of admiration.\\n\\nHigher up the stream, where two branches met about a rocky island, elves\\nseemed gathering for a summer revel.\\n\\nFrom all the landings that lined either shore brilliant boats glided to\\nthe rendezvous; some hung with luminous globes of blue and silver, some\\nwith lanterns fiery-red, flower-shaped, golden, green, or variegated, as\\nif a rainbow were festooned about the viewless masts. Up and down they\\nflashed, stealing out from dusky nooks and floating in their own\\nradiance, as they went to join the procession that wound about the\\nisland like a splendid sea-serpent uncoiling itself from sleep and\\ndarkness.\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t it beautiful?\" cried even the soberest of the townsfolk, as all\\nturned their backs on the shining bridge and bursting rockets to admire\\nthe new spectacle, which was finer than its most enthusiastic advocate\\nexpected. All felt proud of their success as they looked, and even the\\nchildren forgot to shout while watching the pretty pageant that\\npresently came floating by, with music, light, and half-seen figures so\\ncharming, grotesque, or romantic that the illusion was complete.\\n\\nFirst, a boat so covered with green boughs and twinkling yellow sparks\\nthat it looked like a floating island by starlight or a cage of\\nsinging-birds, for music came from within and fresh voices, led by\\nAnnie, sang sweetly as it sailed along. Then a gondola of lovely\\nVenetian ladies, rowed by the handsome artist, who was the pride of the\\ntown. Next a canoe holding three dusky Indians, complete in war-paint,\\nwampum, and tomahawks, paddled before the brilliant barge in which\\nCleopatra sat among red cushions, fanned by two pretty maids. Julia\\'s\\nblack eyes sparkled as she glanced about her, feeling very queen-like\\nwith a golden crown on her head, all the jewelry she could muster on her\\nneck and arms, and grandmother\\'s yellow brocade shining in the light.\\nBelle and Grace waved their peacock fans like two comely little Egyptian\\ndamsels, and the many-colored lanterns made a pretty picture of the\\nwhole.\\n\\nA boatful of jolly little tars followed, with Tom Brown, Jr., as\\nskipper. Then a party of fairies in white, with silver wings and wands,\\nand lanterns like moon and stars.\\n\\nLou Pope, as Lady of the Lake, rowed her own boat, with Jack for a droll\\nlittle Harper, twanging his zitter for want of a better instrument.\\n\\nA black craft hung with lurid red lanterns and manned by a crew of\\nferocious pirates in scarlet shirts, dark beards, and an imposing\\ndisplay of pistols and cutlasses in their belts, not to mention the\\nwell-known skull and cross-bones on the flag flying at the masthead,\\nproduced a tremendous effect as the crew clashed their arms and roared\\nthe blood-thirstiest song they could find. All the boys cheered that,\\nand all the horses pranced as the pirates fired off their pistols,\\ncausing timid ladies to shriek, and prudent drivers to retire from the\\nbridges with their carriage-loads of company.\\n\\nA Chinese junk (or what was intended to look like one, but really\\nresembled a mud-scow), with a party of Mandarins, rich in fans,\\numbrellas, and pigtails, taking tea on board in a blaze of fantastic\\nlanterns, delighted the children.\\n\\nThen a long low boat came sliding by softly, lighted with pale blue\\nlamps, and on a white couch lay \"Elaine,\" the letter in her hand, the\\ngolden hair streaming to her knees, and at her feet the dwarf\\nsorrowfully rowing her down to Camelot. Every one recognized that, for\\nthe master of the revels got it up as no one else could; and Maud\\nlaughed to herself as the floating tableau went under the bridge, and\\nshe heard people rushing to the other side, waiting eagerly to see the\\n\"lily maid\" appear and glide away, followed by applause, as one of the\\nprettiest sights seen that night.\\n\\nThere were eighty boats in all, and as the glittering train wound along\\nthe curves of the river smooth and dark as a mirror, the effect was\\ntruly beautiful, especially when they all congregated below the\\nilluminated bridge, making an island of many-colored light. An enchanted\\nisland it seemed to lookers-on, for music and laughter came from it, and\\na strange mixture of picturesque faces and figures flitted to and fro.\\n\\nElaine sat up and ate bonbons with the faithful dwarf; Ellen Douglas\\nducked the Harper; the Chinamen invited Cleopatra to tea; the mermaids\\npelted the pirates with water-lilies; the gallant gondolier talked art\\nwith the Venetian ladies; and the jolly little tars danced hornpipes,\\nregardless of danger; while the three Indians, Fred, Herbert, and Elly,\\nwhooped and tomahawked right and left as if on the war-path.\\n\\nA regular Midsummer Night\\'s Dream frolic, which every one enjoyed\\nheartily, while the band played patriotic airs, the pretty villa shone\\nlike a fairy palace, and the sky was full of dazzling meteors, falling\\nstars, and long-tailed comets, as the rockets whizzed and blazed from\\nthe hill-tops.\\n\\nJust as the fun was at its height the hurried clang of a bell startled\\nthe merry-makers, and a cry of \"Fire!\" came from the town, causing a\\ngeneral stampede. \"Post-office all afire! Men wanted!\" shouted a\\nbreathless boy, racing through the crowd toward the river. Then great\\nwas the scampering, for shops stood thickly all about the post-office,\\nand distracted merchants hastily collected their goods, while the\\nfiremen smashed windows, ran up and down ladders, broke in doors, and\\npoured streams of water with generous impartiality over everybody and\\neverything in the neighborhood, and the boys flew about, as if this\\nunexpected display of fireworks suited them exactly.\\n\\nSuch noble exertions could not fail of success, and the fire was happily\\nextinguished before the river was pumped dry. Then every one went home,\\nand, feeling the need of refreshment after their labors, had supper all\\nover again, to the great delight of the young folks, who considered this\\na most appropriate finish to an exciting day.\\n\\nBut the merriest party of all was the one gathered on Fred\\'s piazza to\\neat cake and talk over the fun. Such a droll group as they were. The\\nIndians were sadly dilapidated as to feathers and paint, beside being\\nmuddy to the knees, having landed in hot haste. Poor Cleopatra had been\\ndrenched by the hose, but though very damp still sparkled with\\nunextinguishable gayety. Elaine had tied herself up in a big shawl,\\nhaving lost her hat overboard. Jack and Grace wore one waterproof, and\\nAnnie was hoarse with leading her choir of birds on the floating island.\\nAlso several of the pirates wore their beards twisted round behind for\\nthe sake of convenience in eating.\\n\\nAll were wet, warm, and weary, but all rejoiced over the success of the\\nday\\'s delights, and it was unanimously agreed that this had been the\\njolliest Fourth they had ever known.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIV.\\n\\nSEVEN BLACK CATS.\\n\\n\\nThey all came uninvited, they all led eventful lives, and all died\\ntragical deaths; so out of the long list of cats whom I have loved and\\nlost, these seven are the most interesting and memorable.\\n\\nI have no prejudice against color, but it so happened that our pussies\\nwere usually gray or maltese. One white one, who _would_ live in the\\ncoal-bin, was a failure, and we never repeated the experiment. Black\\ncats had not been offered us, so we had no experience of them till\\nnumber one came to us in this wise.\\n\\nSitting at my window, I saw a very handsome puss come walking down the\\nstreet in the most composed and dignified manner. I watched him with\\ninterest, wondering where he was going.\\n\\nPausing now and then, he examined the houses as he passed, as if looking\\nfor a particular number, till, coming to our gate, he pushed it open,\\nand walked in. Straight up to the door he came, and finding it shut sat\\ndown to wait till some one opened it for him.\\n\\nMuch amused, I went at once, and he came directly in, after a long stare\\nat me, and a few wavings of his plumy tail. It was evidently the right\\nplace, and, following me into the parlor, he perched himself on the rug,\\nblinked at the fire, looked round the room, washed his face, and then,\\nlying down in a comfortable sprawl, he burst into a cheerful purr, as if\\nto say,--\\n\\n\"It\\'s all right; the place suits me, and I\\'m going to stay.\"\\n\\nHis coolness amused me very much, and his beauty made me glad to keep\\nhim. He was not a common cat, but, as we afterward discovered, a Russian\\npuss. His fur was very long, black, and glossy as satin; his tail like a\\ngraceful plume, and his eyes as round and yellow as two little moons.\\nHis paws were very dainty, and white socks and gloves, with a neat\\ncollar and shirt-bosom, gave him the appearance of an elegant young\\nbeau, in full evening dress. His face was white, with black hair parted\\nin the middle; and whiskers, fiercely curled up at the end, gave him a\\nmartial look.\\n\\nEvery one admired him, and a vainer puss never caught a mouse. If he saw\\nus looking at him, he instantly took an attitude; gazed pensively at the\\nfire, as if unconscious of our praises; crouched like a tiger about to\\nspring, and glared, and beat the floor with his tail; or lay luxuriously\\noutstretched, rolling up his yellow eyes with a sentimental expression\\nthat was very funny.\\n\\nWe named him the Czar, and no tyrannical emperor of Russia ever carried\\ngreater desolation and terror to the souls of his serfs, than this royal\\ncat did to the hearts and homes of the rats and mice over whom he ruled.\\n\\nThe dear little mice who used to come out to play so confidingly in my\\nroom, live in my best bonnet-box, and bring up their interesting young\\nfamilies in the storeroom, now fell an easy prey to the Czar, who made\\nnothing of catching half a dozen a day.\\n\\nBrazen-faced old rats, gray in sin, who used to walk boldly in and out\\nof the front door, ravage our closets, and racket about the walls by\\nnight, now paused in their revels, and felt that their day was over.\\nCzar did not know what fear was, and flew at the biggest, fiercest rat\\nthat dared to show his long tail on the premises. He fought many a\\ngallant fight, and slew his thousands, always bringing his dead foe to\\ndisplay him to us, and receive our thanks.\\n\\nIt was sometimes rather startling to find a large rat reposing in the\\nmiddle of your parlor; not always agreeable to have an excited cat\\nbounce into your lap, lugging a half-dead rat in his mouth; or to have\\nvisitors received by the Czar, tossing a mouse on the door-steps, like a\\nplayful child with its cup and ball.\\n\\nHe was not fond of petting, but allowed one or two honored beings to\\ncuddle him. My work-basket was his favorite bed, for a certain fat\\ncushion suited him for a pillow, and, having coolly pulled out all the\\npins, the rascal would lay his handsome head on the red mound, and wink\\nat me with an irresistibly saucy expression that made it impossible to\\nscold.\\n\\nAll summer we enjoyed his pranks and admired his manly virtues; but in\\nthe winter we lost him, for, alas! he found his victor in the end, and\\nfell a victim to his own rash daring.\\n\\nOne morning after a heavy snow-fall, Czar went out to take a turn up and\\ndown the path. As he sat with his back to the gate, meditatively\\nwatching some doves on the shed-roof, a big bull-dog entered the yard,\\nand basely attacked him in the rear. Taken by surprise, the dear fellow\\ndid his best, and hit out bravely, till he was dragged into the deep\\nsnow where he could not fight, and there so cruelly maltreated that he\\nwould have been murdered outright, if I had not gone to the rescue.\\n\\nCatching up a broom, I belabored the dog so energetically that he was\\nforced to turn from the poor Czar to me. What would have become of me I\\ndon\\'t know, for the dog was in a rage, and evidently meditating a grab\\nat my ankles, when his master appeared and ordered him off.\\n\\nNever was a boy better scolded than that one, for I poured forth vials\\nof wrath upon his head as I took up my bleeding pet, and pointed to his\\nwounds as indignantly as Antony did to Cæsar\\'s.\\n\\nThe boy fled affrighted, and I bore my poor Czar in to die. All day he\\nlay on his cushion, patient and quiet, with his torn neck tied up in a\\nsoft bandage, a saucer of cream close by, and an afflicted mistress to\\ntend and stroke him with tender lamentations.\\n\\nWe had company in the evening, and my interesting patient was put into\\nanother room. Once, in the midst of conversation, I thought I heard a\\nplaintive mew, but could not go to see, and soon forgot all about it;\\nbut when the guests left, my heart was rent by finding Czar stretched\\nout before the door quite dead.\\n\\nFeeling death approach, he had crept to say good-by, and with a farewell\\nmew had died before the closed door, a brave and faithful cat to the\\nend.\\n\\nHe was buried with great pomp, and before his grave was green, little\\nBlot came to take his place, though she never filled it. Blot\\'s career\\nwas a sad and brief one. Misfortune marked her for its own, and life was\\none too many for her.\\n\\nI saw some boys pelting a wretched object with mud. I delivered a\\nlecture on cruelty to animals, confiscated the victim, and, wrapping\\nher in a newspaper, bore the muddy little beast away in triumph. Being\\nwashed and dried, she turned out a thin black kit, with dirty blue bows\\ntied in her ears. As I don\\'t approve of ear-rings, I took hers out, and\\ntried to fatten her up, for she was a forlorn creature at first.\\n\\nBut Blot would not grow plump. Her early wrongs preyed upon her, and she\\nremained a thin, timid, melancholy little cat all her days. I could not\\nwin her confidence. She had lost her faith in mankind, and I don\\'t blame\\nher. She always hid in corners, quaked when I touched her, took her food\\nby stealth, and sat in a forlorn bunch in cold nooks, down cellar or\\nbehind the gate, mewing despondently to herself, as if her woes must\\nfind a vent. She would _not_ be easy and comfortable. No cushion could\\nallure, no soft beguilements win her to purr, no dainty fare fill out\\nher rusty coat, no warmth or kindness banish the scared look from her\\nsad green eyes, no ball or spool lure her to play, or cause her to wag\\nher mortified thin tail with joy.\\n\\nPoor, dear little Blot! She was a pathetic spectacle, and her end was\\nquite in keeping with the rest of her hard fate. Trying one day to make\\nher come and be cuddled, she retreated to the hearth, and when I pursued\\nher, meaning to catch and pet her, she took a distracted skip right into\\na bed of hot coals. One wild howl, and another still more distracted\\nskip brought her out again, to writhe in agony with four burnt paws and\\na singed skin.\\n\\n\"We must put the little sufferer out of her pain,\" said a strong-minded\\nfriend; and quenched little Blot\\'s life and suffering together in a pail\\nof water.\\n\\nI laid her out sweetly in a nice box, with a doll\\'s blanket folded round\\nher, and, bidding the poor dear a long farewell, confided her to old\\nMacCarty for burial. He was my sexton, and I could trust him to inter my\\ndarlings decently, and not toss them disrespectfully into a dirt-cart or\\nover a bridge.\\n\\nMy dear Mother Bunch was an entire contrast to Blot. Such a fat, cosey\\nold mamma you never saw, and her first appearance was so funny, I never\\nthink of her without laughing.\\n\\nIn our back kitchen was an old sideboard, with two little doors in the\\nlower part. Some bits of carpet were kept there, but we never expected\\nto let that small mansion till, opening the door one day, I found Mrs.\\nBunch and her young family comfortably settled.\\n\\nI had never seen this mild black cat before, and I fancy no one had ever\\nseen her three roly-poly, jet-black kits. Such a confiding puss I never\\nmet, for when I started back, surprised, Mrs. Bunch merely looked at me\\nwith an insinuating purr, and began to pick at my carpet, as if to\\nsay,--\\n\\n\"The house suited me; I\\'ll take it, and pay rent by allowing you to\\nadmire and pet my lovely babies.\"\\n\\nI never thought of turning her out, and there she remained for some\\nmonths, with her children growing up around her, all as fat and funny,\\nblack and amiable, as herself.\\n\\nThree jollier kits were never born, and a more devoted mother never\\nlived. I put her name on the door of her house, and they lived on most\\ncomfortably together, even after they grew too big for their\\naccommodations, and tails and legs hung out after the family had\\nretired.\\n\\nI really did hope they would escape the doom that seemed to pursue my\\ncats, but they did not, for all came to grief in different ways. Cuddle\\nBunch had a fit, and fell out of the window, killing herself instantly.\\nOthello, her brother, was shot by a bad boy, who fired pistols at all\\nthe cats in the neighborhood, as good practice for future gunning\\nexpeditions.\\n\\nLittle Purr was caught in a trap, set for a woodchuck, and so hurt she\\nhad to be gently chloroformed out of life. Mother Bunch still remained,\\nand often used to go and sit sadly under the tree where her infants were\\nburied,--an afflicted, yet resigned parent.\\n\\nHer health declined, but we never had the heart to send her away, and it\\nwouldn\\'t have done any good if we had tried. We did it once, and it was\\na dead failure. At one time the four cats were so wearing that my\\nhonored father, who did not appreciate the dears, resolved to clear the\\nhouse of the whole family; so he packed them in a basket, and carried\\nthem \"over the hills and far away,\" like the \"Babes in the Wood.\" Coming\\nto a lonely spot, he let them out, and returned home, much relieved in\\nmind. Judge of his amazement when the first thing he saw was Mrs. Bunch\\nand her children, sitting on the steps resting after their run home.\\n\\nWe all laughed at the old gentleman so that he left them in peace, and\\neven when the mamma alone remained, feeble and useless, her bereavement\\nmade her sacred.\\n\\nWhen we shut up the house, and went to the city for the winter, we gave\\nMother Bunch to the care of a kind neighbor, who promised to guard her\\nfaithfully. Returning in the spring, one of my first questions was,--\\n\\n\"How is old Pussy?\"\\n\\nGreat was my anguish when my neighbor told me that she was no more. It\\nseems the dear thing pined for her old home, and kept returning to it in\\nspite of age or bad weather.\\n\\nSeveral times she was taken back when she ran away, but at last they\\nwere tired of fussing over her, and let her go. A storm came on, and\\nwhen they went to see what had become of her, they found her frozen, in\\nthe old sideboard, where I first discovered her with her kits about\\nher.\\n\\nAs a delicate attention to me, Mrs. Bunch\\'s skin was preserved, and\\npresented when the tale was told. I kept it some time, but the next\\nChristmas I made it into muffs for several dolls, who were sent me to\\ndress; and very nice little muffs the pretty black fur made, lined with\\ncherry silk, and finished off with tiny tassels.\\n\\nI loved the dear old puss, but I knew the moths would get her skin if I\\nkept it, and preferred to rejoice the hearts of several small friends\\nwith dolls in full winter costume. I am sure Mrs. Bunch would have\\nagreed with me, and not felt that I treated her remains with disrespect.\\n\\nThe last of my cats was the blackest of all, and such a wild thing we\\ncalled him the Imp. He tumbled into the garret one day through a broken\\nscuttle, and took possession of the house from that time forth, acting\\nas if bewitched.\\n\\nHe got into the furnace pipes, but could not get out, and kept me up one\\nwhole night, giving him air and light, food and comfort, through a\\nlittle hole in the floor, while waiting for a carpenter to come and saw\\nhim out.\\n\\nHe got a sad pinch in his tail, which made it crooked forever after. He\\nfell into the soft-soap barrel, and was fished out a deplorable\\nspectacle. He was half strangled by a fine collar we put on him, and was\\nfound hanging by it on a peg.\\n\\nPeople sat down on him, for he would lie in chairs. No one loved him\\nmuch, for he was not amiable in temper, but bit and scratched if\\ntouched, worried the bows off our slippers in his play, and if we did\\nnot attend to him at once, he complained in the most tremendous bass\\ngrowl I ever heard.\\n\\nHe was not beautiful, but very impressive; being big, without a white\\nhair on him. One eye was blue and one green, and the green one was\\nalways half shut, as if he was winking at you, which gave him a rowdy\\nair comical to see. Then he swaggered in his walk, never turned out for\\nany one, and if offended fell into rages fit to daunt the bravest soul.\\n\\nYes, the Imp was truly an awful animal; and when a mischievous cousin of\\nours told us he wanted a black cat, without a single white hair on it,\\nto win a wager with, we at once offered ours.\\n\\nIt seems that sailors are so superstitious they will not sail in a ship\\nwith a black cat; and this rogue of a cousin was going to send puss off\\non a voyage, unknown to any one but the friend who took him, and when\\nthe trip was safely over, he was to be produced as a triumphant proof of\\nthe folly of the nautical superstition.\\n\\nSo the Imp was delivered to his new master, and sailed away packed up in\\nan old fishing-basket, with his head poked out of a hole in the cover.\\n\\nWe waited anxiously to hear how the joke ended; but unfortunately the\\npassage was very rough, his guardian too ill to keep him safe and quiet,\\nso the irrepressible fellow escaped from prison, and betrayed himself by\\ngrowling dismally, as he went lurching across the deck to the great\\ndismay of the sailors.\\n\\nThey chased, caught, and tossed the poor Imp overboard without loss of\\ntime. And when the joke came out, they had the best of it, for the\\nweather happened to improve, and the rest of the voyage was prosperous.\\nSo, of course, they laid it all to the loss of the cat, and were more\\nfixed in their belief than ever.\\n\\nWe were sorry that poor old Imp met so sad a fate, but did not mourn him\\nlong, for he had not won our hearts as some of our other pets had.\\n\\nHe was the last of the seven black cats, and we never had another; for I\\nreally did feel as if there was something uncanny about them after my\\ntragical experiences with Czar, Blot, Mother Bunch\\'s family, and the\\nmartyred Imp.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV.\\n\\nROSA\\'S TALE.\\n\\n\\n\"Now, I believe every one has had a Christmas present and a good time.\\nNobody has been forgotten, not even the cat,\" said Mrs. Ward to her\\ndaughter, as she looked at Pobbylinda, purring on the rug, with a new\\nribbon round her neck and the remains of a chicken bone between her\\npaws.\\n\\nIt was very late, for the Christmas-tree was stripped, the little folks\\nabed, the baskets and bundles left at poor neighbors\\' doors, and\\neverything ready for the happy day which would begin as the clock struck\\ntwelve. They were resting after their labors, while the yule log burned\\ndown; but the mother\\'s words reminded Belinda of one good friend who had\\nreceived no gift that night.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve forgotten Rosa! Her mistress is away, but she _shall_ have a\\npresent nevertheless. Late as it is, she will like some apples and cake\\nand a Merry Christmas from the family.\"\\n\\nBelinda jumped up as she spoke, and, having collected such remnants of\\nthe feast as a horse would relish, she put on her hood, lighted a\\nlantern, and trotted off to the barn.\\n\\nAs she opened the door of the loose box in which Rosa was kept, she saw\\nher eyes shining in the dark as she lifted her head with a startled air.\\nThen, recognizing a friend, she rose and came rustling through the straw\\nto greet her late visitor. She was evidently much pleased with the\\nattention, and rubbed her nose against Miss Belinda gratefully, but\\nseemed rather dainty, and poked over the contents of the basket, as if a\\nlittle suspicious, though apples were her favorite treat.\\n\\nKnowing that she would enjoy the little feast more if she had company\\nwhile she ate it, for Rosa was a very social beast, Miss Belinda hung up\\nthe lantern, and, sitting down on an inverted bucket, watched her as she\\nmunched contentedly.\\n\\n\"Now really,\" said Miss Belinda, when telling her story afterwards, \"I\\nam not sure whether I took a nap and dreamed what follows, or whether\\nit actually happened, for strange things do occur at Christmas time, as\\nevery one knows.\\n\\n\"As I sat there the town clock struck twelve, and the sound reminded me\\nof the legend which affirms that all dumb animals are endowed with\\nspeech for one hour after midnight on Christmas eve, in memory of the\\nanimals about the manger when the blessed Child was born.\\n\\n\"\\'I wish the pretty fancy was a fact, and our Rosa could speak, if only\\nfor an hour, because I am sure she has an interesting history, and I\\nlong to know it.\\'\\n\\n\"I said this aloud, and to my utter amazement the bay mare stopped\\neating, fixed her intelligent eyes upon my face, and answered in a\\nlanguage I understood perfectly well,--\\n\\n\"\\'You shall know it, for whether the legend is true or not I feel as if\\nI could confide in you and tell you all I feel. I was lying awake\\nlistening to the fun in the house, thinking of my dear mistress over the\\nsea and feeling very sad, for I heard you say I was to be sold. That\\nnearly broke my heart, for no one has ever been so kind to me as Miss\\nMerry, and nowhere shall I be taken care of, nursed, and loved as I have\\nbeen since she bought me. I know I am getting old, and stiff in the\\nknees, and my forefoot is lame, and sometimes I\\'m cross when my shoulder\\naches; but I do try to be a patient, grateful beast. I\\'ve got fat with\\ngood living, my work is not hard, I dearly love to carry those who have\\ndone so much for me, and I\\'ll tug for them till I die in harness, if\\nthey will only keep me.\\'\\n\\n\"I was so astonished at this address that I tumbled off the pail, and\\nsat among the straw staring up at Rosa, as dumb as if I had lost the\\npower she had gained. She seemed to enjoy my surprise, and added to it\\nby letting me hear a genuine _horse laugh_, hearty, shrill, and clear,\\nas she shook her pretty head, and went on talking rapidly in the\\nlanguage which I now perceived to be a mixture of English and the\\npeculiar dialect of the horse-country Gulliver visited.\\n\\n\"\\'Thank you for remembering me to-night, and in return for the goodies\\nyou bring I\\'ll tell my story as fast as I can, for I have often longed\\nto recount the trials and triumphs of my life. Miss Merry came last\\nChristmas eve to bring me sugar, and I wanted to speak, but it was too\\nearly and I could not say a word, though my heart was full.\\'\\n\\n\"Rosa paused an instant, and her fine eyes dimmed as if with tender\\ntears at the recollection of the happy year which had followed the day\\nshe was bought from the drudgery of a livery-stable to be a lady\\'s pet.\\nI stroked her neck as she stooped to sniff affectionately at my hood,\\nand said eagerly,--\\n\\n\"\\'Tell away, dear, I\\'m full of interest, and understand every word you\\nsay.\\'\\n\\n\"Thus encouraged, Rosa threw up her head, and began with an air of pride\\nwhich plainly proved, what we had always suspected, that she belonged to\\na good family.\\n\\n\"\\'My father was a famous racer, and I am very like him; the same color,\\nspirit, and grace, and but for the cruelty of man I might have been as\\nrenowned as he. I was a very happy colt, petted by my master, tamed by\\nlove, and never struck a blow while he lived. I gained one race for him,\\nand promised so well that when he died I brought a great price. I\\nmourned for him, but was glad to be sent to my new owner\\'s racing-stable\\nand made much of, for people predicted that I should be another\\nGoldsmith Maid or Flora Temple. Ah, how ambitious and proud I was in\\nthose days! Vain of my good blood, my speed, and my beauty; for indeed I\\n_was_ handsome then, though you may find it hard to believe now.\\' And\\nRosa sighed regretfully as she stole a look at me, and took the attitude\\nwhich showed to advantage the fine lines about her head and neck.\\n\\n\"\\'I do not find it hard, for we have always said you had splendid points\\nabout you. Miss Merry saw them, though you were a skeleton, when she\\nbought you; so did the skilful Cornish blacksmith when he shod you. And\\nit is easy to see that you belong to a good family by the way you hold\\nyour head without a check-rein and carry your tail like a plume,\\' I\\nsaid, with a look of admiration which comforted her as much as if she\\nhad been a _passée_ belle.\\n\\n\"\\'I must hurry over this part of my story, because, though brilliant,\\nit was very brief, and ended in a way which made it the bitterest\\nportion of my life,\\' continued Rosa. \\'I won several races, and great\\nfame was predicted for me. You may guess how high my reputation was when\\nI tell you that before my last fatal trial thousands were bet on me, and\\nmy rival trembled in his shoes. I was full of spirit, eager to show my\\nspeed and sure of success. Alas, how little I knew of the wickedness of\\nhuman nature then, how dearly I bought the knowledge, and how it has\\nchanged my whole life! You do not know much about such matters, of\\ncourse, and I won\\'t digress to tell you all the tricks of the trade;\\nonly beware of jockeys and never bet.\\n\\n\"\\'I was kept carefully out of every one\\'s way for weeks, and only taken\\nout for exercise by my trainer. Poor Bill! I was fond of him, and he was\\nso good to me that I never have forgotten him, though he broke his neck\\nyears ago. A few nights before the great race, as I was getting a good\\nsleep, carefully tucked away in my roomy stall, some one stole in and\\ngave me a warm mash. It was dark, I was half awake, and I ate it like a\\nfool, though I knew by instinct that it was not Bill who fed it to me. I\\nwas a confiding creature then, and as all sorts of queer things had been\\ndone to prepare me I thought it was all right. But it was not, and that\\ndeceit has caused me to be suspicious about my food ever since, for the\\nmash was dosed in some way; it made me very ill, and my enemies nearly\\ntriumphed, thanks to this cowardly trick.\\n\\n\"\\'Bill worked over me day and night, that I might be fit to run. I did\\nmy best to seem well and gay, but there was not time for me to regain my\\nlost strength and spirit, and pride alone kept me up. \"I\\'ll win for my\\nmaster if I die in doing it,\" I said to myself, and when the hour came\\npranced to my place trying to look as well as ever, though my heart was\\nvery heavy and I trembled with excitement. \"Courage, my lass, and we\\'ll\\nbeat in spite of their black tricks,\" whispered Bill, as he sprung to\\nhis place.\\n\\n\"\\'I lost the first heat, but won the second, and the sound of the\\ncheering gave me strength to walk away without staggering, though my\\nlegs shook under me. What a splendid minute that was when, encouraged\\nand refreshed by my faithful Bill, I came on the track again! I knew my\\nenemies began to fear, for I had borne myself so bravely they fancied I\\nwas quite well, and now, excited by that first success, I was mad with\\nimpatience to be off and cover myself with glory.\\'\\n\\n\"Rosa looked as if the \\'splendid minute\\' had come again, for she arched\\nher neck, opened wide her red nostrils, and pawed the straw with one\\nlittle foot, while her eyes shone with sudden fire, and her ears were\\npricked up as if to catch again the shouts she heard that day.\\n\\n\"\\'I wish I had been there to see you!\\' I exclaimed, quite carried away\\nby her ardor.\\n\\n\"\\'I wish you had, for I won, I won! The big black horse did his best,\\nbut I had vowed to win or die, and I kept my word, for I beat him by a\\nhead, and then dropped as if dead. I might as well have died then,\\npeople thought, for the poison, the exertion, and the fall ruined me for\\na racer. My master cared no more for me, and would have had me shot if\\nBill had not saved my life. I was pronounced good for nothing, and he\\nbought me cheap. I was lame and useless for a long time, but his patient\\ncare did wonders, and just as I was able to be of use to him he was\\nkilled.\\n\\n\"\\'A gentleman in want of a saddle-horse purchased me because my easy\\ngait and quiet temper suited him; for I was meek enough now, and my size\\nfitted me to carry his delicate daughter.\\n\\n\"\\'For more than a year I served little Miss Alice, rejoicing to see how\\nrosy her pale cheeks became, how upright her feeble figure grew, thanks\\nto the hours spent with me; for my canter rocked her as gently as if she\\nwere in a cradle, and fresh air was the medicine she needed. She often\\nsaid she owed her life to me, and I liked to think so, for she made _my_\\nlife a very easy one.\\n\\n\"\\'But somehow my good times never lasted long, and when Miss Alice went\\nWest I was sold. I had been so well treated that I _looked_ as handsome\\nand gay as ever, though my shoulder never was strong again, and I often\\nhad despondent moods, longing for the excitement of the race-course with\\nthe instinct of my kind; so I was glad when, attracted by my spirit and\\nbeauty, a young army officer bought me and I went to the war. Ah! you\\nnever guessed that, did you? Yes, I did my part gallantly and saved my\\nmaster\\'s life more than once. You have observed how martial music\\ndelights me, but you don\\'t know that it is because it reminds me of the\\nproudest hour of my life. I\\'ve told you about the saddest; let me relate\\nthis also, and give me a pat for the brave action which won my master\\nhis promotion, though I got no praise for my part of the achievement.\\n\\n\"\\'In one of the hottest battles my captain was ordered to lead his men\\nto a most perilous exploit. They hesitated, so did he; for it must cost\\nmany lives, and, brave as they were, they paused an instant. But _I_\\nsettled the point, for I was wild with the sound of drums, the smell of\\npowder, the excitement of the hour, and, finding myself sharply reined\\nin, I rebelled, took the bit between my teeth, and dashed straight away\\ninto the midst of the fight, spite of all my rider could do. The men\\nthought their captain led them on, and with a cheer they followed,\\ncarrying all before them.\\n\\n\"\\'What happened just after that I never could remember, except that I\\ngot a wound here in my neck and a cut on my flank; the scar is there\\nstill, and I\\'m proud of it, though buyers always consider it a blemish.\\nBut when the battle was won my master was promoted on the field, and I\\ncarried him up to the general as he sat among his officers under the\\ntorn flags.\\n\\n\"\\'Both of us were weary and wounded, both were full of pride at what we\\nhad done; but _he_ got all the praise and the honor, _I_ only a careless\\nword and a better supper than usual.\\n\\n\"\\'I thought no one knew what I had done, and resented the ingratitude of\\nyour race; for it was the horse, not the man, who led that forlorn hope,\\nand I did think I should have a rosette at least, when others got stars\\nand bars for far less dangerous deeds. Never mind, my master knew the\\ntruth, and thanked me for my help by keeping me always with him till the\\nsad day when he was shot in a skirmish, and lay for hours with none to\\nwatch and mourn over him but his faithful horse.\\n\\n\"\\'Then I knew how much he loved and thanked me, for his hand stroked me\\nwhile it had the strength, his eye turned to me till it grew too dim for\\nseeing, and when help came, among the last words he whispered to a\\ncomrade were these, \"Be kind to Rosa and send her safely home; she has\\nearned her rest.\"\\n\\n\"\\'I _had_ earned it, but I did not get it, for when I was sent home the\\nold mother\\'s heart was broken at the loss of her son, and she did not\\nlive long to cherish me. Then my hard times began, for my next owner was\\na fast young man, who ill used me in many ways, till the spirit of my\\nfather rose within me, and I gave my brutal master a grand runaway and\\nsmash-up.\\n\\n\"\\'To tame me down, I was sold for a car horse; and that almost killed\\nme, for it was dreadful drudgery to tug, day after day, over the hard\\npavement with heavy loads behind me, uncongenial companions beside me,\\nand no affection to cheer my life.\\n\\n\"\\'I have often longed to ask why Mr. Bergh does not try to prevent such\\ncrowds from piling into those cars; and now I beg you to do what you can\\nto stop such an unmerciful abuse.\\n\\n\"\\'In snow-storms it was awful, and more than one of my mates dropped\\ndead with overwork and discouragement. I used to wish I could do the\\nsame, for my poor feet, badly shod, became so lame I could hardly walk\\nat times, and the constant strain on the up grades brought back the old\\ntrouble in my shoulder worse than ever.\\n\\n\"\\'Why they did not kill me I don\\'t know, for I was a miserable creature\\nthen; but there must be something attractive about me, I fancy, for\\npeople always seem to think me worth saving. What can it be, ma\\'am?\\'\\n\\n\"\\'Now, Rosa, don\\'t be affected; you know you are a very engaging little\\nanimal, and if you live to be forty will still have certain pretty ways\\nabout you, that win the hearts of women, if not of men. _They_ see your\\nweak points, and take a money view of the case; but _we_ sympathize with\\nyour afflictions, are amused with your coquettish airs, and like your\\naffectionate nature. Now hurry up and finish, for I find it a trifle\\ncold out here.\\'\\n\\n\"I laughed as I spoke, for Rosa eyed me with a sidelong glance and\\ngently waved the docked tail, which was her delight; for the sly thing\\nliked to be flattered and was as fond of compliments as a girl.\\n\\n\"\\'Many thanks. I will come now to the most interesting portion of my\\nnarrative. As I was saying, instead of knocking me on the head I was\\npacked off to New Hampshire, and had a fine rest among the green hills,\\nwith a dozen or so of weary friends. It was during this holiday that I\\nacquired the love of nature which Miss Merry detected and liked in me,\\nwhen she found me ready to study sunsets with her, to admire new\\nlandscapes, and enjoy bright summer weather.\\n\\n\"\\'In the autumn a livery-stable keeper bought me, and through the winter\\nfed me up till I was quite presentable in the spring. It was a small\\ntown, but through the summer many city people visited there, so I was\\nkept on the trot while the season lasted, because ladies could drive me.\\nYou, Miss Belinda, were one of the ladies, and I never shall forget,\\nthough I have long ago forgiven it, how you laughed at my queer gait the\\nday you hired me.\\n\\n\"\\'My tender feet and stiff knees made me tread very gingerly, and amble\\nalong with short mincing steps, which contrasted oddly, I know, with my\\nproudly waving tail and high-carried head. You liked me nevertheless,\\nbecause I didn\\'t rattle you down the steep hills, was not afraid of\\nlocomotives, and stood patiently while you gathered flowers and enjoyed\\nthe lovely prospects.\\n\\n\"\\'I have always felt a regard for you since you did not whip me, and\\nadmired my eyes, which, I may say without vanity, have always been\\nconsidered unusually fine. But no one ever won my whole heart like Miss\\nMerry, and I never shall forget the happy day when she came to the\\nstable to order a saddle-horse. Her cheery voice made me prick up my\\nears, and when she said, after looking at several showy beasts, \"No,\\nthey don\\'t suit me. This one now has the right air; can I ride her?\" my\\nheart danced within me and I looked round with a whinny of delight. She\\nunderstood my welcome, and came right up to me, patted me, peered into\\nmy face, rubbed my nose, and looked at my feet with an air of interest\\nand sympathy, that made me feel as if I\\'d like to carry her round the\\nworld.\\n\\n\"\\'Ah, what rides we had after that! What happy hours trotting gayly\\nthrough the green woods, galloping over the breezy hills, or pacing\\nslowly along quiet lanes, where I often lunched luxuriously on\\nclover-tops, while Miss Merry took a sketch of some picturesque bit with\\nme in the foreground.\\n\\n\"\\'I liked that, and we had long chats at such times, for she seemed to\\nunderstand me perfectly. She was never frightened when I danced for\\npleasure on the soft turf, never chid me when I snatched a bite from the\\nyoung trees as we passed through sylvan ways, never thought it a trouble\\nto let me wet my tired feet in babbling brooks, or to dismount and take\\nout the stones that plagued me.\\n\\n\"\\'Then how well she rode! So firm yet light a seat, so steady a hand, so\\nagile a foot to spring on and off, and such infectious spirits, that no\\nmatter how despondent or cross I might be, in five minutes I felt gay\\nand young again when dear Miss Merry was on my back.\\'\\n\\n\"Here Rosa gave a frisk that sent the straw flying, and made me shrink\\ninto a corner, while she pranced about the box with a neigh which waked\\nthe big brown colt next door, and set poor Buttercup to lowing for her\\ncalf, the loss of which she had forgotten for a little while in sleep.\\n\\n\"\\'Ah, Miss Merry never ran away from me! She knew my heels were to be\\ntrusted, and she let me caper as I would, glad to see me lively. Never\\nmind, Miss Belinda, come out and I\\'ll be sober, as befits my years,\\'\\nlaughed Rosa, composing herself, and adding, so like a woman that I\\ncould not help smiling in the dark,--\\n\\n\"\\'When I say \"years\" I beg you to understand that I am _not_ as old as\\nthat base man declared, but just in the prime of life for a horse. Hard\\nusage has made me seem old before my time, and I am good for years of\\nservice yet.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'Few people have been through as much as you have, Rosa, and you\\ncertainly _have_ earned the right to rest,\\' I said consolingly, for her\\nlittle whims and vanities amused me much.\\n\\n\"\\'You know what happened next,\\' she continued; \\'but I must seize this\\nopportunity to express my thanks for all the kindness I\\'ve received\\nsince Miss Merry bought me, in spite of the ridicule and dissuasion of\\nall her friends.\\n\\n\"\\'I know I didn\\'t look like a good bargain, for I _was_ very thin and\\nlame and shabby; but she saw and loved the willing spirit in me, pitied\\nmy hard lot, and felt that it would be a good deed to buy me even if she\\nnever got much work out of me.\\n\\n\"\\'I shall always remember that, and whatever happens to me hereafter, I\\nnever shall be as proud again as I was the day she put my new saddle and\\nbridle on, and I was led out, sleek, plump, and handsome, with blue\\nrosettes at my ears, my tail cut in the English style, and on my back\\nMiss Merry in her London hat and habit, all ready to head a cavalcade of\\neighteen horsemen and horsewomen. _We_ were the most perfect pair of\\nall, and when the troop caracoled down the wide street six abreast, _my_\\nhead was the highest, _my_ rider the straightest, and _our_ two hearts\\nthe friendliest in all the goodly company.\\n\\n\"\\'Nor is it pride and love alone that binds me to her, it is gratitude\\nas well, for did not she often bathe my feet herself, rub me down, water\\nme, blanket me, and daily come to see me when I was here alone for weeks\\nin the winter time? Didn\\'t she study horses\\' feet and shoes, that I\\nmight be cured if possible? Didn\\'t she write to the famous friend of my\\nrace for advice, and drive me seven miles to get a good smith to shoe me\\nwell? Have not my poor contracted feet grown much better, thanks to the\\nweeks of rest without shoes which she gave me? Am I not fat and\\nhandsome, and, barring the stiff knees, a very presentable horse? If I\\nam, it is all owing to her; and for that reason I want to live and die\\nin her service.\\n\\n\"\\'_She_ doesn\\'t want to sell me, and only bade you do it because you\\ndidn\\'t want the care of me while she is gone. Dear Miss Belinda, please\\nkeep me! I\\'ll eat as little as I can. I won\\'t ask for a new blanket,\\nthough your old army one is very thin and shabby. I\\'ll trot for you all\\nwinter, and try not to show it if I am lame. I\\'ll do anything a horse\\ncan, no matter how humble, to earn my living, only don\\'t, pray don\\'t\\nsend me away among strangers who have neither interest nor pity for me!\\'\\n\\n\"Rosa had spoken rapidly, feeling that her plea must be made now or\\nnever, for before another Christmas she might be far away and speech of\\nno use to win her wish. I was much touched, though she was only a\\nhorse; for she was looking earnestly at me as she spoke, and made the\\nlast words very eloquent by preparing to bend her stiff knees and lie\\ndown at my feet. I stopped her, and answered, with an arm about her neck\\nand her soft nose in my hand,--\\n\\n\"\\'You shall _not_ be sold, Rosa! you shall go and board at Mr. Town\\'s\\ngreat stable, where you will have pleasant society among the eighty\\nhorses who usually pass the winter there. Your shoes shall be taken off,\\nand you shall rest till March at least. The best care will be taken of\\nyou, dear, and I will come and see you; and in the spring you shall\\nreturn to us, even if Miss Merry is not here to welcome you.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'Thanks, many, many thanks! But I wish I could do something to earn my\\nboard. I hate to be idle, though rest _is_ delicious. Is there nothing I\\ncan do to repay you, Miss Belinda? Please answer quickly, for I know the\\nhour is almost over,\\' cried Rosa, stamping with anxiety; for, like all\\nher sex, she wanted the last word.\\n\\n\"\\'Yes, you can,\\' I cried, as a sudden idea popped into my head. \\'I\\'ll\\nwrite down what you have told me, and send the little story to a certain\\npaper I know of, and the money I get for it will pay your board. So rest\\nin peace, my dear; you _will_ have earned your living, and may feel that\\nyour debt is paid.\\'\\n\\n\"Before she could reply the clock struck one, and a long sigh of\\nsatisfaction was all the response in her power. But we understood each\\nother now, and, cutting a lock from her mane for Miss Merry, I gave Rosa\\na farewell caress and went away, wondering if I had made it all up, or\\nif she had really broken a year\\'s silence and freed her mind.\\n\\n\"However that may be, here is the tale, and the sequel to it is, that\\nthe bay mare has really gone to board at a first-class stable,\"\\nconcluded Miss Belinda. \"I call occasionally and leave my card in the\\nshape of an apple, finding Madam Rosa living like an independent lady,\\nwith her large box and private yard on the sunny side of the barn, a\\nkind ostler to wait upon her, and much genteel society from the city\\nwhen she is inclined for company.\\n\\n\"What more could any reasonable horse desire?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVI.\\n\\nLUNCH.\\n\\n\\n\"Sister Jerusha, it really does wear upon me to see those dear boys eat\\nsuch bad pies and stuff day after day when they ought to have good\\nwholesome things for lunch. I actually ache to go and give each one of\\n\\'em a nice piece of bread-and-butter or one of our big cookies,\" said\\nkind Miss Mehitable Plummer, taking up her knitting after a long look at\\nthe swarm of boys pouring out of the grammar school opposite, to lark\\nabout the yard, sit on the posts, or dive into a dingy little shop close\\nby, where piles of greasy tarts and cakes lay in the window. They would\\nnot have allured any but hungry school-boys, and ought to have been\\nlabelled Dyspepsia and Headache, so unwholesome were they.\\n\\nMiss Jerusha looked up from her seventeenth patchwork quilt, and\\nanswered, with a sympathetic glance over the way,--\\n\\n\"If we had enough to go round I\\'d do it myself, and save these poor\\ndeluded dears from the bilious turns that will surely take them down\\nbefore vacation comes. That fat boy is as yellow as a lemon now, and no\\nwonder, for I\\'ve seen him eat half a dozen dreadful turnovers for one\\nlunch.\"\\n\\nBoth old ladies shook their heads and sighed, for they led a very quiet\\nlife in the narrow house that stood end to the street, squeezed in\\nbetween two stores, looking as out of place as the good spinsters would\\nhave done among the merry lads opposite. Sitting at the front windows\\nday after day, the old ladies had learned to enjoy watching the boys,\\nwho came and went, like bees to a hive, month by month. They had their\\nfavorites, and beguiled many a long hour speculating on the looks,\\nmanners, and probable station of the lads. One lame boy was Miss\\nJerusha\\'s pet, though she never spoke to him, and a tall bright-faced\\nfellow, who rather lorded it over the rest, quite won Miss Hetty\\'s old\\nheart by helping her across the street on a slippery day. They longed to\\nmend some of the shabby clothes, to cheer up the dull discouraged ones,\\nadvise the sickly, reprove the rude, and, most of all, feed those who\\npersisted in buying lunch at the dirty bake-shop over the way.\\n\\nThe good souls were famous cooks, and had many books full of all manner\\nof nice receipts, which they seldom used, as they lived simply and saw\\nlittle company. A certain kind of molasses cookie made by their honored\\nmother,--a renowned housewife in her time,--and eaten by the sisters as\\nchildren, had a peculiar charm for them. A tin box was always kept full,\\nthough they only now and then nibbled one, and preferred to give them\\naway to poor children, as they trotted to market each day. Many a time\\nhad Miss Hetty felt sorely tempted to treat the boys, but was a little\\ntimid, for they were rough fellows, and she regarded them much as a\\nbenevolent tabby would a party of frisky puppies.\\n\\nTo-day the box was full of fresh cookies, crisp, brown, and sweet; their\\nspicy odor pervaded the room, and the china-closet door stood\\nsuggestively open. Miss Hetty\\'s spectacles turned that way, then went\\nback to the busy scene in the street, as if trying to get courage for\\nthe deed. Something happened just then which decided her, and sealed\\nthe doom of the bilious tarts and their maker.\\n\\nSeveral of the younger lads were playing marbles on the sidewalk, for\\nHop Scotch, Leap Frog, and friendly scuffles were going on in the yard,\\nand no quiet spot could be found. The fat boy sat on a post near by,\\nand, having eaten his last turnover, fell to teasing the small fellows\\npeacefully playing at his feet. One was the shabby lame boy, who hopped\\nto and fro with his crutch, munching a dry cracker, with now and then a\\ntrip to the pump to wash it down. He seldom brought any lunch, and\\nseemed to enjoy this poor treat so much that the big bright-faced chap\\ntossed him a red apple as he came out of the yard to get his hat, thrown\\nthere by the mate he had been playfully thrashing.\\n\\nThe lame child eyed the pretty apple lovingly, and was preparing to take\\nthe first delicious bite, when the fat youth with a dexterous kick sent\\nit flying into the middle of the street, where a passing wheel crushed\\nit down into the mud.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a shame! He _shall_ have something good! The scamp!\" And with this\\nsomewhat confused exclamation Miss Hetty threw down her work, ran to\\nthe closet, then darted to the front door, embracing the tin box, as if\\nthe house was on fire and that contained her dearest treasures.\\n\\n\"Sakes alive, what _is_ the matter with sister?\" ejaculated Miss\\nJerusha, going to the window just in time to see the fat boy tumble off\\nthe post as the tall lad came to the rescue, while the cripple went\\nhopping across the street in answer to a kindly quavering voice that\\ncalled out to him,--\\n\\n\"Come here, boy, and get a cookie,--a dozen if you want \\'em.\"\\n\\n\"Sister\\'s done it at last!\" And, inspired by this heroic example, Miss\\nJerusha threw up the window, saying, as she beckoned to the avenger,--\\n\\n\"You too, because you stood by that poor little boy. Come right over and\\nhelp yourself.\"\\n\\nCharley Howe laughed at the indignant old ladies, but, being a\\ngentleman, took off his hat and ran across to thank them for their\\ninterest in the fray. Several other lads followed as irresistibly as\\nflies to a honey-pot, for the tin box was suggestive of cake, and they\\nwaited for no invitation.\\n\\nMiss Hetty was truly a noble yet a droll sight, as she stood there, a\\ntrim little old lady, with her cap-strings flying in the wind, her rosy\\nold face shining with good-will, as she dealt out cookies with a lavish\\nhand, and a kind word to all.\\n\\n\"Here\\'s a nice big one for you, my dear. I don\\'t know your name, but I\\ndo your face, and I like to see a big boy stand up for the little ones,\"\\nshe said, beaming at Charley as he came up.\\n\\n\"Thank you, ma\\'am. That\\'s a splendid one. We don\\'t get anything so nice\\nover there.\" And Charley gratefully bolted the cake in three mouthfuls,\\nhaving given away his own lunch.\\n\\n\"No, indeed! One of these is worth a dozen of those nasty pies. I hate\\nto see you eating them, and I don\\'t believe your mothers know how bad\\nthey are,\" said Miss Hetty, diving for another handful into the depths\\nof the box, which was half empty already.\\n\\n\"Wish you\\'d teach old Peck how you make \\'em. We\\'d be glad enough to buy\\nthese and let the cockroach pies alone,\" said Charley, accepting another\\nand enjoying the fun, for half the fellows were watching the scene from\\nover the way.\\n\\n\"Cockroach pies! You don\\'t mean to say?\" cried Miss Hetty, nearly\\ndropping her load in her horror at the idea, for she had heard of\\nfricasseed frogs and roasted locusts, and thought a new delicacy had\\nbeen found.\\n\\n\"We find \\'em in the apple-sauce sometimes, and nails and bits of barrel\\nin the cake, so some of us don\\'t patronize Peck,\" replied Charley; and\\nlittle Briggs the cripple added eagerly,--\\n\\n\"I never do; my mother won\\'t let me.\"\\n\\n\"He never has any money, that\\'s why,\" bawled Dickson, the fat boy,\\ndodging behind the fence as he spoke.\\n\\n\"Never you mind, sonny, you come here every day, and _I\\'ll_ see that you\\nhave a good lunch. Apples too, _red ones_, if you like them, with your\\ncake,\" answered Miss Hetty, patting his head and sending an indignant\\nglance across the street.\\n\\n\"Cry-baby! Molly-coddle! Grandma\\'s darling!\" jeered Dickson, and then\\nfled, for Charley fired a ball at him with such good aim it narrowly\\nescaped his nose.\\n\\n\"That boy will have the jaundice as sure as fate, and he deserves it,\"\\nsaid Miss Hetty, sternly, as she dropped the lid on the now empty box;\\nfor while she was talking the free-and-easy young gentlemen had been\\nhelping themselves.\\n\\n\"Thank you very much, ma\\'am, for my cookie. I won\\'t forget to call\\nto-morrow.\" And little Briggs shook hands with as innocent a face as if\\nhis jacket pocket was not bulging in a most suspicious manner.\\n\\n\"You\\'ll get your death a cold, Hetty,\" called Miss Jerusha, and, taking\\nthe hint, Charley promptly ended the visit.\\n\\n\"Sheer off, fellows. We are no end obliged, ma\\'am, and I\\'ll see that\\nBriggs isn\\'t put upon by sneaks.\"\\n\\nThen the boys ran off, and the old lady retired to her parlor to sink\\ninto her easy-chair, as much excited by this little feat as if she had\\nled a forlorn hope to storm a battery.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll fill both those big tins to-morrow, and treat every one of the\\nsmall boys, if I\\'m spared,\" she panted, with a decided nod, as she\\nsettled her cap and composed her neat black skirts, with which the wind\\nhad taken liberties, as she stood on the steps.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not sure it isn\\'t our duty to make and sell good, wholesome lunches\\nto those boys. We can afford to do it cheap, and it wouldn\\'t be much\\ntrouble. Just put the long table across the front entry for half an hour\\nevery day, and let them come and get a bun, a cookie, or a buttered\\nbiscuit. It could be done, sister,\" said Miss Jerusha, longing to\\ndistinguish herself in some way also.\\n\\n\"It _shall_ be done, sister!\" And Miss Hetty made up her mind at that\\nmoment to devote some of her time and skill to rescuing those blessed\\nboys from the unprincipled Peck and his cockroach pies.\\n\\nIt was pleasant, as well as droll, to see how heartily the good souls\\nthrew themselves into the new enterprise, how bravely they kept each\\nother up when courage showed signs of failing, and how rapidly they\\nbecame convinced that it was a duty to provide better food for the\\nfuture defenders and rulers of their native land.\\n\\n\"You can\\'t expect the dears to study with clear heads if they are not\\nfed properly, and half the women in the world never think that what\\ngoes into children\\'s stomachs affects their brains,\" declared Miss\\nHetty, as she rolled out vast sheets of dough next day, emphasizing her\\nremarks with vigorous flourishes of the rolling-pin.\\n\\n\"Our blessed mother understood how to feed a family. Fourteen stout boys\\nand girls, all alive and well, and you and I as smart at seventy one and\\ntwo, as most folks at forty. Good, plain victuals and plenty of \\'em is\\nthe secret of firm health,\" responded Miss Jerusha, rattling a pan of\\nbuns briskly into the oven.\\n\\n\"We\\'d better make some Brighton Rock. It is gone out of fashion, but our\\nbrothers used to be dreadful fond of it, and boys are about alike all\\nthe world over. Ma\\'s _resate_ never fails, and it will be a new treat\\nfor the little dears.\"\\n\\n\"S\\'pose we have an extra can of milk left and give \\'em a good mugful?\\nSome of those poor things look as if they never got a drop. Peck sells\\nbeer, and milk is a deal better. Shall we, sister?\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ll try it, Jerushy. In for a penny, in for a pound.\"\\n\\nAnd upon that principle the old ladies did the thing handsomely,\\ndeferring the great event till Monday, that all might be in apple-pie\\norder. They said nothing of it when the lads came on Friday morning, and\\nall Saturday, which was a holiday at school, was a very busy one with\\nthem.\\n\\n\"Hullo! Miss Hetty _has_ done it now, hasn\\'t she? Look at that, old\\nPeck, and tremble!\" exclaimed Charley to his mates, as he came down the\\nstreet on Monday morning, and espied a neat little sign on the sisters\\'\\ndoor, setting forth the agreeable fact that certain delectable articles\\nof food and drink could be had within at reasonable prices during\\nrecess.\\n\\nNo caps were at the windows, but behind the drawn curtains two beaming\\nold faces were peeping out to see how the boys took the great\\nannouncement. Whoever remembers Hawthorne\\'s half-comic, half-pathetic\\ndescription of poor Hepsibah Pyncheon\\'s hopes and fears, when arranging\\nher gingerbread wares in the little shop, can understand something of\\nthe excitement of the sisters that day, as the time drew near when the\\nfirst attempt was to be made.\\n\\n\"Who will set the door open?\" said Miss Hetty when the fateful moment\\ncame, and boys began to pour out into the yard.\\n\\n\"I will!\" And, nerving herself to the task, Miss Jerusha marched boldly\\nround the table, set wide the door, and then, as the first joyful whoop\\nfrom the boys told that the feast was in view, she whisked back into the\\nparlor panic-stricken.\\n\\n\"There they come,--hundreds of them, I should think by the sound!\" she\\nwhispered, as the tramp of feet came nearer, and the clamor of voices\\nexclaiming,--\\n\\n\"What bully buns!\" \"Ain\\'t those cookies rousers?\" \"New stuff too, looks\\nfirst-rate.\" \"I told you it wasn\\'t a joke.\" \"Wonder how Peck likes it?\"\\n\"Dickson sha\\'n\\'t come in.\" \"You go first, Charley.\" \"Here\\'s a cent for\\nyou, Briggs; come on and trade like the rest of us.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m so flurried I couldn\\'t make change to save my life,\" gasped Miss\\nJerusha from behind the sofa, whither she had fled.\\n\\n\"It is _my_ turn now. Be calm, and we shall soon get used to it.\"\\n\\nBracing herself to meet the merry chaff of the boys, as new and trying\\nto the old lady as real danger would have been, Miss Hetty stepped forth\\ninto the hall to be greeted by a cheer, and then a chorus of demands for\\neverything so temptingly set forth upon her table. Intrenched behind a\\nbarricade of buns, she dealt out her wares with rapidly increasing speed\\nand skill, for as fast as one relay of lads were satisfied another came\\nup, till the table was bare, the milk-can ran dry, and nothing was left\\nto tell the tale but an empty water-pail and a pile of five-cent pieces.\\n\\n\"I hope I didn\\'t cheat any one, but I was flurried, sister, they were so\\nvery noisy and so hungry. Bless their dear hearts; they are full now, I\\ntrust.\" And Miss Hetty looked over her glasses at the crumby\\ncountenances opposite, meeting many nods and smiles in return, as her\\nlate customers enthusiastically recommended her establishment to the\\npatronage of those who had preferred Peck\\'s questionable dainties.\\n\\n\"The Brighton Rock was a success; we must have a good store for\\nto-morrow, and more milk. Briggs drank it like a baby, and your nice\\nboy proposed my health like a little gentleman, as he is,\" replied Miss\\nJerusha, who had ventured out before it was too late, and done the\\nhonors of the can with great dignity, in spite of some inward\\ntrepidation at the astonishing feats performed with the mug.\\n\\n\"Peck\\'s nose is out of joint, if I may use so vulgar an expression, and\\n_our_ lunch a triumphant success. Boys know what is good, and we need\\nnot fear to lose their custom as long as we can supply them. I shall\\norder a barrel of flour at once, and heat up the big oven. We have put\\nour hand to the work and must not turn back, for our honor is pledged\\nnow.\"\\n\\nWith which lofty remark Miss Hetty closed the door, trying to look\\nutterly unconscious of the anxious Peck, who was flattening his nose\\nagainst his dingy window-pane to survey his rivals over piles of unsold\\npastry.\\n\\nThe little venture _was_ a success, and all that winter the old ladies\\ndid their part faithfully, finding the task more to their taste than\\neverlasting patchwork and knitting, and receiving a fair profit on\\ntheir outlay, being shrewd managers, and rich in old-fashioned thrift,\\nenergy, and industry.\\n\\nThe boys revelled in wholesome fare, and soon learned to love \"the\\nAunties,\" as they were called, while such of the parents as took an\\ninterest in the matter showed their approval in many ways most\\ngratifying to the old ladies.\\n\\nThe final triumph, however, was the closing of Peck\\'s shop for want of\\ncustom, for few besides the boys patronized him. None mourned for him,\\nand Dickson proved the truth of Miss Hetty\\'s prophecy by actually having\\na bilious fever in the spring.\\n\\nBut a new surprise awaited the boys; for when they came flocking back\\nafter the summer vacation, there stood the little shop, brave in new\\npaint and fittings, full of all the old goodies, and over the door a\\nsmart sign, \"Plummer & Co.\"\\n\\n\"By Jove, the Aunties are bound to cover themselves with glory. Let\\'s go\\nin and hear all about it. Behave now, you fellows, or I\\'ll see about it\\nafterward,\" commanded Charley, as he paused to peer in through the clean\\nwindows at the tempting display.\\n\\nIn they trooped, and, tapping on the counter, stood ready to greet the\\nold ladies as usual, but to their great surprise a pretty young woman\\nappeared, and smilingly asked what they would have.\\n\\n\"We want the Aunties, if you please. Isn\\'t this their shop?\" said little\\nBriggs, bitterly disappointed at not finding his good friends.\\n\\n\"You will find them over there at home as usual. Yes, this is their\\nshop, and I\\'m their niece. My husband is the Co., and we run the shop\\nfor the aunts. I hope you\\'ll patronize us, gentlemen.\"\\n\\n\"We will! we will! Three cheers for Plummer & Co.!\" cried Charley,\\nleading off three rousers, that made the little shop ring again, and\\nbrought two caps to the opposite windows, as two cheery old faces smiled\\nand nodded, full of satisfaction at the revolution so successfully\\nplanned and carried out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVII.\\n\\nA BRIGHT IDEA.\\n\\n\\n\"No answer to my advertisement, mamma, and I must sit with idle hands\\nfor another day,\" said Clara with a despondent sigh, as the postman\\npassed the door.\\n\\n\"You needn\\'t do that, child, when I\\'m suffering for a new cap, and no\\none can suit me so well as you, if you have the spirits to do it,\"\\nanswered her mother from the sofa, where she spent most of her time\\nbewailing her hard lot.\\n\\n\"Plenty of spirits, mamma, and what is still more necessary, plenty of\\nmaterials; so I\\'ll toss you up \\'a love of a cap\\' before you know it.\"\\n\\nAnd putting her own disappointment out of sight, pretty Clara fell to\\nwork with such good-will that even poor, fretful Mrs. Barlow cheered up\\nin spite of herself.\\n\\n\"What a mercy it is that when everything else is swept away in this\\ndreadful failure I still have you, dear, and no dishonest banker can rob\\nme of my best treasure,\" she said fondly, as she watched her daughter\\nwith tearful eyes.\\n\\n\"No one shall part us, mamma; and if I can only get something to do we\\ncan be independent and happy in spite of our losses; for now the first\\nshock and worry is over, I find a curious sort of excitement in being\\npoor and having to work for my living. I was so tired of pleasure and\\nidleness I really quite long to work at something, if I could only find\\nit.\"\\n\\nBut though Clara spoke cheerfully, she had a heavy heart; for during the\\nmonth which had followed the discovery that they were nearly penniless,\\nshe had been through a great deal for a tenderly nurtured girl of\\nthree-and-twenty. Leaving a luxurious home for two plainly furnished\\nrooms, and trying to sustain her mother with hopeful plans, had kept her\\nbusy for a time; but now she had nothing to do but wait for replies to\\nher modest advertisements as governess, copyist, or reader.\\n\\n\"I do wish I\\'d been taught a trade, mamma, or some useful art by which\\nI could earn our bread now. Rich people ought to remember that money\\ntakes to itself wings, and so prepare their children to face poverty\\nbravely. If half the sums spent on my music and dress had been used in\\ngiving me a single handicraft, what a blessing it would be to us now!\"\\nshe said, thoughtfully, as she sewed with rapid fingers, unconsciously\\ndisplaying the delicate skill of one to whom dress was an art and a\\npleasure.\\n\\n\"If you were not so proud we might accept Cousin John\\'s offer and be\\nquite comfortable,\" returned her mother, in a reproachful tone.\\n\\n\"No; we should soon feel that we were a burden, and that would be worse\\nthan living on bread and water. Let us try to help ourselves first, and\\nthen, if we fail, we cannot be accused of indolence. I know papa would\\nwish it, so please let me try.\"\\n\\n\"As you like; _I_ shall not be a burden to any one long.\" And Mrs.\\nBarlow looked about for her handkerchief.\\n\\nBut Clara prevented the impending shower by skilfully turning the poor\\nlady\\'s thoughts to the new cap which was ready to try on.\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t it pretty? Just the soft effect that is so becoming to your dear,\\npale face. Take a good look at it, and tell me whether you\\'ll have pale\\npink bows or lavender.\"\\n\\n\"It is very nice, child; you always suit me, you\\'ve such charming taste.\\nI\\'ll have lavender, for though it\\'s not so becoming as pink, it is more\\nappropriate to our fallen fortunes,\" answered her mother, smiling in\\nspite of herself, as she studied effects in the mirror.\\n\\n\"No, let us have it pink, for I want my pretty mother to look her best,\\nthough no one sees her but me, and I\\'m so glad to know that I _can_ make\\ncaps well if I can\\'t do anything else,\" said Clara, rummaging in a box\\nfor the desired shade.\\n\\n\"No one ever suited me so well, and if you were not a lady, you might\\nmake a fortune as a milliner, for you have the taste of a Frenchwoman,\"\\nsaid Mrs. Barlow, adding, as she took her cap off, \"Don\\'t you remember\\nhow offended Madame Pigat was when she found out that you altered all\\nher caps before I wore them, and how she took some of your hints and got\\nall the credit of them?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, mamma,\" was all Clara answered, and then sat working so silently\\nthat it was evident her thoughts were as busy as her hands. Presently\\nshe said, \"I must go down to our big box for the ribbon, there is none\\nhere that I like,\" and, taking a bunch of keys, she went slowly away.\\n\\nIn the large parlor below stood several trunks and cases belonging to\\nMrs. Barlow, and left there for her convenience, as the room was unlet.\\n\\nClara opened several of these, and rapidly turned over their contents,\\nas if looking for something beside pale pink ribbon. Whatever it was she\\nappeared to find it, for, dropping the last lid with a decided bang, she\\nstood a moment looking about the large drawing-room with such\\nbrightening eyes it was evident that they saw some invisible beauty\\nthere; then a smile broke over her face, and she ran up stairs to waken\\nher mother from a brief doze, by crying joyfully, as she waved a curl of\\ngay ribbon over her head,--\\n\\n\"I\\'ve got it, mamma, I\\'ve got it!\"\\n\\n\"Bless the child! what have you got,--a letter?\" cried Mrs. Barlow,\\nstarting up.\\n\\n\"No; but something better still,--a new way to get a living. I\\'ll be a\\nmilliner, and you shall have as many caps as you like. Now don\\'t laugh,\\nbut listen; for it is a splendid idea, and you shall have all the credit\\nof it, because you suggested it.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve materials enough,\" she continued, \"to begin with; for when all\\nelse went, they left us our finery, you know, and now we can live on it\\ninstead of wearing it. Yes, I\\'ll make caps and sell them, and that will\\nbe both easier and pleasanter than to go out teaching and leave you here\\nalone.\"\\n\\n\"But how _can_ you sell them?\" asked her mother, half bewildered by the\\neagerness with which the new plan was unfolded.\\n\\n\"That\\'s the best of all, and I only thought of it when I was among the\\nboxes. Why not take the room below and lay out all our fine things\\ntemptingly, instead of selling them one by one as if we were ashamed of\\nit?\\n\\n\"As I stood there just now, I saw it all. Mrs. Smith would be glad to\\nlet the room, and I could take it for a month, just to try how my plan\\nworks; and if it _does_ go well, why can I not make a living as well as\\nMadame?\"\\n\\n\"But, child, what will people say?\"\\n\\n\"That I\\'m an honest girl, and lend me a hand, if they are friends worth\\nhaving.\"\\n\\nMrs. Barlow was not convinced, and declared she would hide herself if\\nany one came; but after much discussion consented to let the trial be\\nmade, though predicting utter failure, as she retired to her sofa to\\nbewail the sad necessity for such a step.\\n\\nClara worked busily for several days to carry into execution her plan;\\nthen she sent some notes to a dozen friends, modestly informing them\\nthat her \"opening\" would take place on a certain day.\\n\\n\"Curiosity will bring them, if nothing else,\" she said, trying to seem\\nquite cool and gay, though her heart fluttered with anxiety as she\\narranged her little stock in the front parlor.\\n\\nIn the bay-window was her flower-stand, where the white azaleas, red\\ngeraniums, and gay nasturtiums seemed to have bloomed their loveliest to\\nhelp the gentle mistress who had tended them so faithfully, even when\\nmisfortune\\'s frost had nipped her own bright roses. Overhead swung a\\npair of canaries in their garlanded cage, singing with all their might,\\nas if, like the London \\'prentice-boys in old times, they cried, \"What do\\nyou lack? Come buy, come buy!\"\\n\\nOn a long table in the middle of the room, a dozen delicate caps and\\nhead-dresses were set forth. On another lay garlands of French flowers\\nbought for pretty Clara\\'s own adornment. Several dainty ball-dresses,\\nimported for the gay winter she had expected to pass, hung over chairs\\nand couch, also a velvet mantle Mrs. Barlow wished to sell, while some\\nold lace, well-chosen ribbons, and various elegant trifles gave color\\nand grace to the room.\\n\\nClara\\'s first customer was Mrs. Tower,--a stout florid lady, full of the\\ngood-will and the real kindliness which is so sweet in times of trouble.\\n\\n\"My dear girl, how are you, and how is mamma? Now this is charming. Such\\na capital idea, and just what is needed; a quiet place, where one can\\ncome and be made pretty without all the world\\'s knowing how we do it.\"\\nAnd greeting Clara even more cordially than of old, the good lady\\ntrotted about, admiring everything, just as she used to do when she\\nvisited the girl in her former home to see and exclaim over any fresh\\narrival of Paris finery.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll take this mantle off your hands with pleasure, for I intended to\\nimport one, and this saves me so much trouble. Put it up for me, dear,\\nat the price mamma paid for it, not a cent less, because it has never\\nbeen worn, and I\\'ve no duties to pay on it, so it is a good bargain for\\nme.\"\\n\\nThen, before Clara could thank her, she turned to the head-gear, and\\nfell into raptures over a delicate affair, all blonde and\\nforget-me-nots.\\n\\n\"Such a sweet thing! I _must_ have it before any one else snaps it up.\\nTry it on, love, and give it a touch if it doesn\\'t fit.\"\\n\\nClara knew it would be vain to remonstrate, for Mrs. Tower had not a\\nparticle of taste, and insisted on wearing blue, with the complexion of\\na lobster. On it went, and even the wearer could not fail to see that\\nsomething was amiss.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not the fault of the cap, dear. I always was a fright, and my\\ndreadful color spoils whatever I put on, so I have things handsome, and\\ngive up any attempt at beauty,\" she said, shaking her head at herself in\\nthe glass.\\n\\n\"You need not do that, and I\\'ll show you what I mean, if you will give\\nme leave; for, with your fine figure and eyes, you can\\'t help being an\\nelegant woman. See, now, how I\\'ll make even this cap becoming.\" And\\nClara laid the delicate flowers among the blonde behind, where the\\neffect was unmarred by the over-red cheeks, and nothing but a soft ruche\\nlay over the dark hair in front.\\n\\n\"There, isn\\'t that better?\" she asked, with her own blooming face so\\nfull of interest it was a pleasure to see her.\\n\\n\"Infinitely better; really becoming, and just what I want with my new\\nsilver-gray satin. Dear me, what a thing taste is!\" And Mrs. Tower\\nregarded herself with feminine satisfaction in her really fine eyes.\\n\\nHere a new arrival interrupted them, and Clara went to meet several\\ngirls belonging to what had lately been her own set. The young ladies\\ndid not quite know how to behave; for, though it seemed perfectly\\nnatural to be talking over matters of dress with Clara, there was an air\\nof proud humility about her that made them feel ill at ease, till\\nNellie, a lively, warm-hearted creature, broke the ice by saying, with a\\nlittle quiver in her gay voice,--\\n\\n\"It\\'s no use, girls; we\\'ve either got to laugh or cry, and I think, on\\nthe whole, it would be best for all parties to laugh, and then go on\\njust as we used to do;\" which she did so infectiously that the rest\\njoined, and then began to chatter as freely as of old.\\n\\n\"I speak for the opal silk, Clara, for papa has promised me a Worth\\ndress, and I was green with envy when this came,\" cried Nellie, secretly\\nwishing she wore caps, that she might buy up the whole dozen.\\n\\n\"You would be green with disgust if I let you have it, for no brunette\\ncould wear that most trying of colors, and I was rash to order it. You\\nare very good, dear Nell, but I won\\'t let you sacrifice yourself to\\nfriendship in that heroic style,\" answered Clara, with a grateful kiss.\\n\\n\"But the others are blue and lilac, both more trying than anything with\\na shade of pink in it. If you won\\'t let me have this, you must invent\\nme the most becoming thing ever seen; for the most effective dress I had\\nlast winter was the gold-colored one with the wreath of laburnums, which\\nyou chose for me,\" persisted Nellie, bound to help in some way.\\n\\n\"I bespeak something sweet for New Year\\'s Day. You know my style,\" said\\nanother young lady, privately resolving to buy the opal dress, when the\\nrest had gone.\\n\\n\"Consider yourself engaged to get up my bridesmaids\\' costumes, for I\\nnever shall forget what a lovely effect those pale green dresses\\nproduced at Alice\\'s wedding. She looked like a lily among its leaves,\\nsome one said, and you suggested them, I remember,\" added a third\\ndamsel, with the dignity of a bride-elect.\\n\\nSo it went on, each doing what she could to help, not with condolence,\\nbut approbation, and the substantial aid that is so easy to accept when\\ngilded by kind words and cheery sympathy.\\n\\nA hard winter, but a successful one; and when spring came, and all her\\npatrons were fitted out for mountains, seaside, or springs, Clara folded\\nher weary hands content. But Mrs. Barlow saw with anxiety how pale the\\ngirl\\'s cheeks had grown, how wistfully she eyed the green grass in the\\npark, and how soon the smile died on the lips that tried to say\\ncheerfully,--\\n\\n\"No, mamma, dear, I dare not spend in a summer trip the little sum I\\nhave laid by for the hard times that may come. I shall do very well, but\\nI can\\'t help remembering the happy voyage we meant to make this year,\\nand how much good it would do _you_.\"\\n\\nWatching the unselfish life of her daughter had taught Mrs. Barlow to\\nforget her own regrets, inspired her with a desire to do her part, and\\nmade her ashamed of her past indolence.\\n\\nHappening to mention her maternal anxieties to Mrs. Tower, that good\\nlady suggested a plan by which the seemingly impossible became a fact,\\nand Mrs. Barlow had the pleasure of surprising Clara with a \"bright\\nidea,\" as the girl had once surprised her.\\n\\n\"Come, dear, bestir yourself, for we must sail in ten days to pass our\\nsummer in or near Paris. I\\'ve got commissions enough to pay our way,\\nand we can unite business and pleasure in the most charming manner.\"\\n\\nClara could only clasp her hands and listen, as her mother unfolded her\\nplan, telling how she was to get Maud\\'s trousseau, all Mrs. Tower\\'s\\nwinter costumes, and a long list of smaller commissions from friends and\\npatrons who had learned to trust and value the taste and judgment of the\\nyoung _modiste_.\\n\\nSo Clara had her summer trip, and came home bright and blooming in the\\nearly autumn, ready to take up her pretty trade again, quite unconscious\\nthat, while trying to make others beautiful, she was making her own life\\na very lovely one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVIII.\\n\\nHOW THEY CAMPED OUT.\\n\\n\\n\"It looks so much like snow I think it would be wiser to put off your\\nsleighing party, Gwen,\" said Mrs. Arnold, looking anxiously out at the\\nheavy sky and streets still drifted by the last winter storm.\\n\\n\"Not before night, mamma; we don\\'t mind its being cloudy, we like it,\\nbecause the sun makes the snow so dazzling when we get out of town. \"We\\ncan\\'t give it up now, for here comes Patrick with the boys.\" And Gwen\\nran down to welcome the big sleigh, which just then drove up with four\\njolly lads skirmishing about inside.\\n\\n\"Come on!\" called Mark, her brother, knocking his friends right and\\nleft, to make room for the four girls who were to complete the party.\\n\\n\"What do you think of the weather, Patrick?\" asked Mrs. Arnold from the\\nwindow, still undecided about the wisdom of letting her flock go off\\nalone, papa having been called away after the plan was made.\\n\\n\"Faith, ma\\'m, it\\'s an illigant day barring the wind, that\\'s a thrifle\\ncould to the nose. I\\'ll have me eye on the childer, ma\\'m, and there\\'ll\\nbe no throuble at all, at all,\" replied the old coachman, lifting a\\nround red face out of his muffler, and patting little Gus on the\\nshoulder, as he sat proudly on the high seat holding the whip.\\n\\n\"Be careful, dears, and come home early.\"\\n\\nWith which parting caution mamma shut the window, and watched the young\\nfolks drive gayly away, little dreaming what would happen before they\\ngot back.\\n\\nThe wind was more than a \"thrifle could,\" for when they got out of the\\ncity it blew across the open country in bitter blasts, and made the\\neight little noses almost as red as old Pat\\'s, who had been up all night\\nat a wake, and was still heavy-headed with too much whiskey, though no\\none suspected it.\\n\\nThe lads enjoyed themselves immensely snowballing one another; for the\\ndrifts were still fresh enough to furnish soft snow, and Mark, Bob, and\\nTony had many a friendly tussle in it as they went up hills, or paused\\nto breathe the horses after a swift trot along a level bit of road.\\nLittle Gus helped drive till his hands were benumbed in spite of the new\\nred mittens, and he had to descend among the girls, who were cuddled\\ncosily under the warm robes, telling secrets, eating candy, and laughing\\nat the older boys\\' pranks.\\n\\nSixteen-year-old Gwendoline was matron of the party, and kept excellent\\norder among the girls; for Ruth and Alice were nearly her own age, and\\nRita a most obedient younger sister.\\n\\n\"I say, Gwen, we are going to stop at the old house on the way home and\\nget some nuts for this evening. Papa said we might, and some of the big\\nBaldwins too. I\\'ve got baskets, and while we fellows fill them you girls\\ncan look round the house,\" said Mark, when the exhausted young gentlemen\\nreturned to their seats.\\n\\n\"That will be nice. I want to get some books, and Rita has been very\\nanxious about one of her dolls, which she is sure was left in the\\nnursery closet. If we are going to stop we ought to be turning back,\\nPat, for it is beginning to snow and will be dark early,\" answered Gwen,\\nsuddenly realizing that great flakes were fast whitening the roads and\\nthe wind had risen to a gale.\\n\\n\"Shure and I will, miss dear, as soon as iver I can; but it\\'s round a\\ngood bit we must go, for I couldn\\'t be turning here widout upsettin\\' the\\nwhole of yez, it\\'s that drifted. Rest aisy, and I\\'ll fetch up at the\\nould place in half an hour, plaze the powers,\" said Pat, who had lost\\nhis way and wouldn\\'t own it, being stupid with a sup or two he had\\nprivately taken on the way, to keep the chill out of his bones he said.\\n\\nOn they went again, with the wind at their backs, caring little for the\\nsnow that now fell fast, or the gathering twilight, since they were\\ngoing toward home they thought. It was a very long half-hour before Pat\\nbrought them to the country-house, which was shut up for the winter.\\nWith difficulty they ploughed their way up to the steps, and scrambled\\non to the piazza, where they danced about to warm their feet till Mark\\nunlocked the door and let them in, leaving Pat to enjoy a doze on his\\nseat.\\n\\n\"Make haste, boys; it is cold and dark here, and we must get home. Mamma\\nwill be so anxious, and it really is going to be a bad storm,\" said\\nGwen, whose spirits were damped by the gloom of the old house, and who\\nfelt her responsibility, having promised to be home early.\\n\\nOff went the boys to attic and cellar, being obliged to light the\\nlantern left here for the use of whoever came now and then to inspect\\nthe premises. The girls, having found books and doll, sat upon the\\nrolled-up carpets, or peeped about at the once gay and hospitable rooms,\\nnow looking very empty and desolate with piled-up furniture, shuttered\\nwindows, and fireless hearths.\\n\\n\"If we were going to stay long I\\'d have a fire in the library. Papa\\noften does when he comes out, to keep the books from moulding,\" began\\nGwen, but was interrupted by a shout from without, and, running to the\\ndoor, saw Pat picking himself out of a drift while the horses were\\ngalloping down the avenue at full speed.\\n\\n\"Be jabbers, them villains give a jump when that fallin\\' branch struck\\n\\'em, and out I wint, bein\\' tuk unknownst, just thinkin\\' of me poor\\ncousin Mike. May his bed above be aisy the day! Whist now, miss dear!\\nI\\'ll fetch \\'em back in a jiffy. Stop still till I come, and kape them\\nb\\'ys quite.\"\\n\\nWith a blow to settle his hat, Patrick trotted gallantly away into the\\nstorm, and the girls went in to tell the exciting news to the lads, who\\ncame whooping back from their search, with baskets of nuts and apples.\\n\\n\"Here\\'s a go!\" cried Mark. \"Old Pat will run half-way to town before he\\ncatches the horses, and we are in for an hour or two at least.\"\\n\\n\"Then do make a fire, for we shall die of cold if we have to wait long,\"\\nbegged Gwen, rubbing Rita\\'s cold hands, and looking anxiously at little\\nGus, who was about making up his mind to roar.\\n\\n\"So we will, and be jolly till the blunderbuss gets back. Camp down,\\ngirls, and you fellows, come and hold the lantern while I get wood and\\nstuff. It is so confoundedly dark, I shall break my neck down the shed\\nsteps.\" And Mark led the way to the library, where the carpet still\\nremained, and comfortable chairs and sofas invited the chilly visitors\\nto rest.\\n\\n\"How can you light your fire when you get the wood?\" asked Ruth, a\\npractical damsel, who looked well after her own creature comforts and\\nwas longing for a warm supper.\\n\\n\"Papa hides the matches in a tin box, so the rats won\\'t get at them.\\nHere they are, and two or three bits of candle for the sticks on the\\nchimney-piece, if he forgets to have the lantern trimmed. Now we will\\nlight up, and look cosey when the boys come back.\"\\n\\nAnd producing the box from under a sofa-cushion, Gwen cheered the hearts\\nof all by lighting two candles, rolling up the chairs, and making ready\\nto be comfortable. Thoughtful Alice went to see if Pat was returning,\\nand found a buffalo-robe lying on the steps. Returning with this, she\\nreported that there was no sign of the runaways, and advised making\\nready for a long stay.\\n\\n\"How mamma will worry!\" thought Gwen, but made light of the affair,\\nbecause she saw Rita looked timid, and Gus shivered till his teeth\\nchattered.\\n\\n\"We will have a nice time, and play we are shipwrecked people or Arctic\\nexplorers. Here comes Dr. Kane and the sailors with supplies of wood,\\nso we can thaw our pemmican and warm our feet. Gus shall be the little\\nEsquimaux boy, all dressed in fur, as he is in the picture we have at\\nhome,\" she said, wrapping the child in the robe, and putting her own\\nsealskin cap on his head to divert his mind.\\n\\n\"Here we are! Now for a jolly blaze, boys; and if Pat doesn\\'t come back\\nwe can have our fun here instead of at home,\" cried Mark, well pleased\\nwith the adventure, as were his mates.\\n\\nSo they fell to work, and soon a bright fire was lighting up the room\\nwith its cheerful shine, and the children gathered about it, quite\\ncareless of the storm raging without, and sure that Pat would come in\\ntime.\\n\\n\"I\\'m hungry,\" complained Gus as soon as he was warm.\\n\\n\"So am I,\" added Rita from the rug, where the two little ones sat\\ntoasting themselves.\\n\\n\"Eat an apple,\" said Mark.\\n\\n\"They are so hard and cold I don\\'t like them,\" began Gus.\\n\\n\"Roast some!\" cried Ruth.\\n\\n\"And crack nuts,\" suggested Alice.\\n\\n\"Pity we can\\'t cook something in real camp style; it would be such fun,\"\\nsaid Tony, who had spent weeks on Monadnock, living upon the supplies he\\nand his party tugged up the mountain on their backs.\\n\\n\"We shall not have time for anything but what we have. Put down your\\napples and crack away, or we shall be obliged to leave them,\" advised\\nGwen, coming back from an observation at the front door with an anxious\\nline on her forehead; for the storm was rapidly increasing, and there\\nwas no sign of Pat or the horses.\\n\\nThe rest were in high glee, and an hour or two slipped quickly away as\\nthey enjoyed the impromptu feast and played games. Gus recalled them to\\nthe discomforts of their situation by saying with a yawn and a\\nwhimper,--\\n\\n\"I\\'m so sleepy! I want my own bed and mamma.\"\\n\\n\"So do I!\" echoed Rita, who had been nodding for some time, and longed\\nto lie down and sleep comfortably anywhere.\\n\\n\"Almost eight o\\'clock! By Jove, that old Pat _is_ taking his time, I\\nthink. Wonder if he has got into trouble? We can\\'t do anything, and may\\nas well keep quiet here,\" said Mark, looking at his watch and beginning\\nto understand that the joke was rather a serious one.\\n\\n\"Better make a night of it and all go to sleep. Pat can wake us up when\\nhe comes. The cold makes a fellow _so_ drowsy.\" And Bob gave a stretch\\nthat nearly rent him asunder.\\n\\n\"I will let the children nap on the sofa. They are so tired of waiting,\\nand may as well amuse themselves in that way as in fretting. Come, Gus\\nand Rita, each take a pillow, and I\\'ll cover you up with my shawl.\"\\n\\nGwen made the little ones comfortable, and they were off in five\\nminutes. The others kept up bravely till nine o\\'clock, then the bits of\\ncandles were burnt out, the stories all told, nuts and apples had lost\\ntheir charm, and weariness and hunger caused spirits to fail\\nperceptibly.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve eaten five Baldwins, and yet I want more. Something filling and\\ngood. Can\\'t we catch a rat and roast him?\" proposed Bob, who was a\\nhearty lad and was ravenous by this time.\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t there anything in the house?\" asked Ruth, who dared not eat nuts\\nfor fear of indigestion.\\n\\n\"Not a thing that I know of except a few pickles in the storeroom; we\\nhad so many, mamma left some here,\" answered Gwen, resolving to\\nprovision the house before she left it another autumn.\\n\\n\"Pickles alone are rather sour feed. If we only had a biscuit now, they\\nwouldn\\'t be bad for a relish,\" said Tony, with the air of a man who had\\nknown what it was to live on burnt bean-soup and rye flapjacks for a\\nweek.\\n\\n\"I saw a keg of soft-soap in the shed. How would that go with the\\npickles?\" suggested Bob, who felt equal to the biggest and acidest\\ncucumber ever grown.\\n\\n\"Mamma knew an old lady who actually did eat soft-soap and cream for her\\ncomplexion,\" put in Alice, whose own fresh face looked as if she had\\ntried the same distasteful remedy with success.\\n\\nThe boys laughed, and Mark, who felt that hospitality required him to do\\nsomething for his guests, said briskly,--\\n\\n\"Let us go on a foraging expedition while the lamp holds out to burn,\\nfor the old lantern is almost gone and then we are done for. Come on,\\nBob; your sharp nose will smell out food if there is any.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t set the house afire, and bring more wood when you come, for we\\nmust have light of some kind in this poky place,\" called Gwen, with a\\nsigh, wishing every one of them were safely at home and abed.\\n\\nA great tramping of boots, slamming of doors, and shouting of voices\\nfollowed the departure of the boys, as well as a crash, a howl, and then\\na roar of laughter, as Bob fell down the cellar stairs, having opened\\nthe door in search of food and poked his nose in too far. Presently they\\ncame back, very dusty, cobwebby, and cold, but triumphantly bearing a\\ndroll collection of trophies. Mark had a piece of board and the lantern,\\nTony a big wooden box and a tin pail, Bob fondly embraced a pickle jar\\nand a tumbler of jelly which had been forgotten on a high shelf in the\\nstoreroom.\\n\\n\"Meal, pickles, jam, and boards. What a mess, and what are we to do with\\nit all?\" cried the girls, much amused at the result of the expedition.\\n\\n\"Can any of you make a hoe cake?\" demanded Mark.\\n\\n\"No, indeed! I can make caramels and cocoanut-cakes,\" said Ruth,\\nproudly.\\n\\n\"I can make good toast and tea,\" added Alice.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t cook anything,\" confessed Gwen, who was unusually accomplished\\nin French, German, and music.\\n\\n\"Girls aren\\'t worth much in the hour of need. Take hold, Tony, you are\\nthe chap for me.\" And Mark disrespectfully turned his back on the young\\nladies, who could only sit and watch the lads work.\\n\\n\"He can\\'t do it without water,\" whispered Ruth.\\n\\n\"Or salt,\" answered Alice.\\n\\n\"Or a pan to bake it in,\" added Gwen; and then all smiled at the dilemma\\nthey foresaw.\\n\\nBut Tony was equal to the occasion, and calmly went on with his task,\\nwhile Mark arranged the fire and Bob opened the pickles. First the new\\ncook filled the pail with snow till enough was melted to wet the meal;\\nthis mixture was stirred with a pine stick till thick enough, then\\nspread on the board and set up before the bed of coals to brown.\\n\\n\"It never will bake in the world.\" \"He can\\'t turn it, so it won\\'t be\\ndone on both sides.\" \"Won\\'t be fit to eat any way!\" And with these dark\\nhints the girls consoled themselves for their want of skill.\\n\\nBut the cake did bake a nice brown, Tony did turn it neatly with his\\njack-knife and the stick, and when it was done cut it into bits, added\\njelly, and passed it round on an old atlas; and every one said,--\\n\\n\"It really does taste good!\"\\n\\nTwo more were baked, and eaten with pickles for a change, then all were\\nsatisfied, and after a vote of thanks to Tony they began to think of\\nsleep.\\n\\n\"Pat has gone home and told them we are all right, and mamma knows we\\ncan manage here well enough for one night, so don\\'t worry, Gwen, but\\ntake a nap, and I\\'ll lie on the rug and see to the fire.\"\\n\\nMark\\'s happy-go-lucky way of taking things did not convince his sister;\\nbut as she could do nothing, she submitted and made her friends as\\ncomfortable as she could.\\n\\nAll had plenty of wraps, so the girls nestled into the three large\\nchairs, Bob and Tony rolled themselves up in the robe, with their feet\\nto the fire, and were soon snoring like weary hunters. Mark pillowed his\\nhead on a log, and was sound asleep in ten minutes in spite of his\\npromise to be sentinel.\\n\\nGwen\\'s chair was the least easy of the three, and she could not forget\\nherself like the rest, but sat wide awake, watching the blaze, counting\\nthe hours, and wondering why no one came to them.\\n\\nThe wind blew fiercely, the snow beat against the blinds, rats scuttled\\nabout the walls, and now and then a branch fell upon the roof with a\\ncrash. Weary, yet excited, the poor girl imagined all sorts of mishaps\\nto Pat and the horses, recalled various ghost stories she had heard, and\\nwondered if it was on such a night as this that a neighbor\\'s house had\\nbeen robbed. So nervous did she get at last that she covered up her face\\nand resolutely began to count a thousand, feeling that anything was\\nbetter than having to wake Mark and own she was frightened.\\n\\nBefore she knew it she fell into a drowse and dreamed that they were\\nall cast away on an iceberg and a polar bear was coming up to devour\\nGus, who innocently called to the big white dog and waited to caress\\nhim.\\n\\n\"A bear! a bear! oh, boys, save him!\" murmured Gwen in her sleep, and\\nthe sound of her own distressed voice waked her.\\n\\nThe fire was nearly out, for she had slept longer than she knew, the\\nroom was full of shadows, and the storm seemed to have died away. In the\\nsilence which now reigned, unbroken even by a snore, Gwen heard a sound\\nthat made her start and tremble. Some one was coming softly up the back\\nstairs. All the outer doors were locked, she was sure; all the boys lay\\nin their places, for she could see and count the three long figures and\\nlittle Gus in a bunch on the sofa. The girls had not stirred, and this\\nwas no rat\\'s scamper, but a slow and careful tread, stealing nearer and\\nnearer to the study door, left ajar when the last load of wood was\\nbrought in.\\n\\n\"Pat would knock or ring, and papa would speak, so that we might not be\\nscared. I want to scream, but I won\\'t till I see that it really is some\\none,\" thought Gwen, while her heart beat fast and her eyes were fixed on\\nthe door, straining to see through the gloom.\\n\\nThe steps drew nearer, paused on the threshold, and then a head appeared\\nas the door noiselessly swung wider open. A man\\'s head in a fur cap, but\\nit was neither papa nor Pat nor Uncle Ed. Poor Gwen would have called\\nout then, but her voice was gone, and she could only lie back, looking,\\nmute and motionless. A tiny spire of flame sprung up and flickered for a\\nmoment on the tall dark figure in the doorway, a big man with a beard,\\nand in his hand something that glittered. Was it a pistol or a dagger or\\na dark lantern? thought the girl, as the glimmer died away, and the\\nshadows returned to terrify her.\\n\\nThe man seemed to look about him keenly for a moment, then vanished, and\\nthe steps went down the hall to the front door, which was opened from\\nwithin and some one admitted quietly. Whispers were heard, and then feet\\napproached again, accompanied by a gleam of light.\\n\\n\"Now I must scream!\" thought Gwen; and scream she did with all her\\nmight, as two men entered, one carrying a lantern, the other a bright\\ntin can.\\n\\n\"Boys! Robbers! Fire! Tramps! Oh, do wake up!\" cried Gwen, frantically\\npulling Mark by the hair, and Bob and Tony by the legs, as the quickest\\nway of rousing them.\\n\\nThen there was a scene! The boys sprung up and rubbed their eyes, the\\ngirls hid theirs and began to shriek, while the burglars laughed aloud,\\nand poor Gwen, quite worn out, fainted away on the rug. It was all over\\nin a minute, however; for Mark had his wits about him, and his first\\nglance at the man with the lantern allayed his fears.\\n\\n\"Hullo, Uncle Ed! We are all right. Got tired of waiting for you, so we\\nwent to sleep.\"\\n\\n\"Stop screaming, girls, and quiet those children! Poor little Gwen is\\nbadly frightened. Get some snow, Tom, while I pick her up,\" commanded\\nthe uncle, and order was soon established.\\n\\nThe boys were all right at once, and Ruth and Alice devoted themselves\\nto the children, who were very cross and sleepy in spite of their\\nfright. Gwen was herself in a moment, and so ashamed of her scare that\\nshe was glad there was no more light to betray her pale cheeks.\\n\\n\"I should have known you, uncle, at once, but to see a strange man\\nstartled me, and he didn\\'t speak, and I thought that can was a pistol,\"\\nstammered Gwen, when she had collected her wits a little.\\n\\n\"Why, that\\'s my old friend and captain, Tom May. Don\\'t you remember him,\\nchild? He thought you were all asleep, so crept out to tell me and let\\nme in.\"\\n\\n\"How did he get in himself?\" asked Gwen, glad to turn the conversation.\\n\\n\"Found the shed door open, and surprised the camp by a flank movement.\\nYou wouldn\\'t do for picket duty, boys,\" laughed Captain Tom, enjoying\\nthe dismay of the lads.\\n\\n\"Oh, thunder! I forgot to bolt it when we first went for the wood. Had\\nto open it, the place was so plaguy dark,\" muttered Bob, much disgusted.\\n\\n\"Where\\'s Pat?\" asked Tony, with great presence of mind, feeling anxious\\nto shift all blame to his broad shoulders.\\n\\nUncle Ed shook the snow from his hair and clothes, and, poking up the\\nfire, leisurely sat down and took Gus on his knee before he\\nreplied,--\"Serve out the grog, Tom, while I spin my yarn.\"\\n\\nRound went the can of hot coffee, and a few sips brightened up the young\\nfolks immensely, so that they listened with great interest to the tale\\nof Pat\\'s mishaps.\\n\\n\"The scamp was half-seas over when he started, and deserves all he got.\\nIn the first place he lost his way, then tumbled overboard, and let the\\nhorses go. He floundered after them a mile or two, then lost his\\nbearings in the storm, pitched into a ditch, broke his head, and lay\\nthere till found. The fellows carried him to a house off the road, and\\nthere he is in a nice state; for, being his countrymen, they dosed him\\nwith whiskey till he was \\'quite and aisy,\\' and went to sleep, forgetting\\nall about you, the horses, and his distracted mistress at home. The\\nanimals were stopped at the cross-roads, and there we found them after a\\nlively cruise round the country. Then we hunted up Pat; but what with\\nthe blow and too many drops of \\'the crayther,\\' his head was in a muddle,\\nand we could get nothing out of him. So we went home again, and then\\nyour mother remembered that you had mentioned stopping here, and we\\nfitted out a new craft and set sail, prepared for a long voyage. Your\\nfather was away, so Tom volunteered, and here we are.\"\\n\\n\"A jolly lark! now let us go home and go to bed,\" proposed Mark, with a\\ngape.\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t it most morning?\" asked Tony, who had been sleeping like a\\ndormouse.\\n\\n\"Just eleven. Now pack up and let us be off. The storm is over, the moon\\ncoming out, and we shall find a good supper waiting for the loved and\\nlost. Bear a hand, Tom, and ship this little duffer, for he\\'s off\\nagain.\"\\n\\nUncle Ed put Gus into the captain\\'s arms, and, taking Rita himself, led\\nthe way to the sleigh which stood at the door. In they all bundled, and\\nafter making the house safe, off they went, feeling that they had had a\\npretty good time on the whole.\\n\\n\"I will learn cooking and courage, before I try camping out again,\"\\nresolved Gwen, as she went jingling homeward; and she kept her word.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIX.\\n\\nMY LITTLE SCHOOL-GIRL.\\n\\n\\nThe first time that I saw her was one autumn morning as I rode to town\\nin a horse-car. It was early, and my only fellow-passenger was a crusty\\nold gentleman, who sat in a corner, reading his paper; so when the car\\nstopped, I glanced out to see who came next, hoping it would be a\\npleasanter person. No one appeared for a minute, and the car stood\\nstill, while both driver and conductor looked in the same direction\\nwithout a sign of impatience. I looked also, but all I could see was a\\nlittle girl running across the park, as girls of twelve or thirteen\\nseldom run nowadays, if any one can see them.\\n\\n\"Are you waiting for her?\" I asked of the pleasant-faced conductor, who\\nstood with his hand on the bell, and a good-natured smile in his eyes.\\n\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am, we always stop for little missy,\" he answered; and just\\nthen up she came, all rosy and breathless with her run.\\n\\n\"Thank you very much. I\\'m late to-day, and was afraid I should miss my\\ncar,\" she said, as he helped her in with a fatherly air that was\\npleasant to see.\\n\\nTaking a corner seat, she smoothed the curly locks, disturbed by the\\nwind, put on her gloves, and settled her books in her lap, then modestly\\nglanced from the old gentleman in the opposite corner to the lady near\\nby. Such a bright little face as I saw under the brown hat-rim, happy\\nblue eyes, dimples in the ruddy cheeks, and the innocent expression\\nwhich makes a young girl so sweet an object to old eyes.\\n\\nThe crusty gentleman evidently agreed with me, for he peeped over the\\ntop of the paper at his pleasant little neighbor as she sat studying a\\nlesson, and cheering herself with occasional sniffs at a posy of\\nmignonette in her button-hole.\\n\\nWhen the old gentleman caught my eye, he dived out of sight with a loud\\n\"Hem!\" but he was peeping again directly, for there was something\\nirresistibly attractive about the unconscious lassie opposite; and one\\ncould no more help looking at her than at a lovely flower or a playful\\nkitten.\\n\\nPresently she shut her book with a decided pat, and an air of relief\\nthat amused me. She saw the half-smile I could not repress, seemed to\\nunderstand my sympathy, and said with a laugh,--\\n\\n\"It _was_ a hard lesson, but I\\'ve got it!\"\\n\\nSo we began to talk about school and lessons, and I soon discovered that\\nthe girl was a clever scholar, whose only drawback was, as she confided\\nto me, a \"love of fun.\"\\n\\nWe were just getting quite friendly, when several young men got in, one\\nof whom stared at the pretty child till even she observed it, and showed\\nthat she did by the color that came and went in her cheeks. It annoyed\\nme as much as if she had been my own little daughter, for I like\\nmodesty, and have often been troubled by the forward manners of\\nschoolgirls, who seem to enjoy being looked at. So I helped this one\\nout of her little trouble by making room between the old gentleman and\\nmyself, and motioning her to come and sit there.\\n\\nShe understood at once, thanked me with a look, and nestled into the\\nsafe place so gratefully, that the old gentleman glared over his\\nspectacles at the rude person who had disturbed the serenity of the\\nchild.\\n\\nThen we rumbled along again, the car getting fuller and fuller as we got\\ndown town. Presently an Irishwoman, with a baby, got in, and before I\\ncould offer my seat, my little school-girl was out of hers, with a\\npolite--\\n\\n\"Please take it, ma\\'am; I can stand perfectly well.\"\\n\\nIt was prettily done, and I valued the small courtesy all the more,\\nbecause it evidently cost the bashful creature an effort to stand up\\nalone in a car full of strangers; especially as she could not reach the\\nstrap to steady herself, and found it difficult to stand comfortably.\\n\\nThen it was that the crusty man showed how he appreciated my girl\\'s good\\nmanners, for he hooked his cane in the strap, and gave it to her,\\nsaying, with a smile that lighted up his rough face like sunshine,--\\n\\n\"Hold on to that, my dear.\"\\n\\n\"Ah,\" thought I, \"how little we can judge from appearances! This grim\\nold soul is a gentleman, after all.\"\\n\\nTurning her face towards us, the girl held on to the stout cane, and\\nswayed easily to and fro as we bumped over the rails. The Irishwoman\\'s\\nbaby, a sickly little thing, was attracted by the flowers, and put out a\\nsmall hand to touch them, with a wistful look at the bright face above.\\n\\n\"Will baby have some?\" said my girl, and made the little creature happy\\nwith some gay red leaves.\\n\\n\"Bless your heart, honey, it\\'s fond he is of the like o\\' them, and\\nseldom he gets any,\" said the mother, gratefully, as she settled baby\\'s\\ndirty hood, and wrapped the old shawl round his feet.\\n\\nBaby stared hard at the giver of posies, but his honest blue eyes gave\\nno offence, and soon the two were so friendly that baby boldly clutched\\nat the bright buttons on her sack, and crowed with delight when he got\\none, while we all smiled at the pretty play, and were sorry when the\\nlittle lady, with a bow and a smile to us, got out at the church corner.\\n\\n\"Now, I shall probably never see that child again, yet what a pleasant\\npicture she leaves in my memory!\" I thought to myself, as I caught a\\nlast glimpse of the brown hat going round the corner.\\n\\nBut I did see her again many times that winter; for not long after, as I\\npassed down a certain street near my winter quarters, I came upon a\\nflock of girls, eating their luncheon as they walked to and fro on the\\nsunny side,--pretty, merry creatures, all laughing and chattering at\\nonce, as they tossed apples from hand to hand, munched candy, or\\ncompared cookies. I went slowly, to enjoy the sight, as I do when I meet\\na party of sparrows on the Common, and was wondering what would become\\nof so many budding women, when, all of a sudden, I saw _my_ little\\nschool-girl.\\n\\nYes, I knew her in a minute, for she wore the same brown hat, and the\\nrosy face was sparkling with fun, as she told secrets with a chosen\\nfriend, while eating a wholesome slice of bread-and-butter as only a\\nhungry school-girl could.\\n\\nShe did not recognize me, but I took a good look at her as I went by,\\nlonging to know what the particular secret was that ended in such a gale\\nof laughter.\\n\\nAfter that, I often saw my girl as I took my walks abroad, and one day\\ncould not resist speaking to her when I met her alone; for usually her\\nmates clustered round her like bees about their queen, which pleased me,\\nsince it showed how much they loved the sunshiny child.\\n\\nI had a paper of grapes in my hand, and when I saw her coming, whisked\\nout a handsome bunch, all ready to offer, for I had made up my mind to\\nspeak this time. She was reading a paper, but looked up to give me the\\ninside of the walk.\\n\\nBefore her eyes could fall again, I held out the grapes and said, just\\nas I had heard her say more than once to a schoolmate at lunch-time,\\n\"Let\\'s go halves.\"\\n\\nShe understood at once, laughed, and took the bunch, saying with\\ntwinkling eyes,--\\n\\n\"Oh, thank you! they are beauties!\"\\n\\nThen, as we went on to the corner together, I told her why I did it, and\\nrecalled the car-ride.\\n\\n\"I\\'d forgotten all about that, but my conductor is very kind, and always\\nwaits for me,\" she said, evidently surprised that a stranger should take\\nan interest in her small self.\\n\\nI did not have half time enough with her, for a bell rang, and away she\\nskipped, looking back to nod and smile at the queer lady who had taken a\\nfancy to her.\\n\\nA few days afterward a fine nosegay of flowers was left at the door for\\nme, and when I asked the servant who sent them he answered,--\\n\\n\"A little girl asked if a lame lady didn\\'t live here, and when I said\\nyes, she told me to give you these, and say the grapes were very nice.\"\\n\\nI knew at once who it was, and enjoyed the funny message immensely; for\\nwhen one leads a quiet life, little things interest and amuse.\\n\\nChristmas was close by, and I planned a return for the flowers, of a\\nsort, that I fancied my young friend would appreciate.\\n\\nI knew that Christmas week would be a holiday, so, the day before it\\nbegan, I went to the school just before recess, and left a frosted plum\\ncake, directed to \"Miss Goldilocks, from she knows who.\"\\n\\nAt first I did not know how to address my nice white parcel, for I never\\nhad heard the child\\'s name. But after thinking over the matter, I\\nremembered that she was the only girl there with yellow curls hanging\\ndown her back, so I decided to risk the cake with the above direction.\\n\\nThe maid who took it in (for my girl went to a private school) smiled,\\nand said at once she knew who I meant. I left my cake, and strolled\\nround the corner to the house of a friend, there to wait and watch for\\nthe success of my joke, for the girls always went that way at recess.\\n\\nPresently the little hats began to go bobbing by, the silent street to\\necho with laughter, and the sidewalk to bloom with gay gowns, for the\\ngirls were all out in winter colors now.\\n\\nFrom behind a curtain I peeped at them, and saw, with great\\nsatisfaction, that nearly all had bits of my cake in their hands, and\\nwere talking it over with the most flattering interest. My particular\\nlittle girl, with a friend on each arm, passed so near me that I could\\nsee the happy look in her eyes, and hear her say, with a toss of the\\nbright hair,--\\n\\n\"Mother will plan it for me, and I can get it done by New Year. Won\\'t it\\nbe fun to hang it on the door some day, and then run?\"\\n\\nI fancied that she meant to make something for me, and waited with\\npatience, wondering how this odd frolic with my little school-girl would\\nend.\\n\\nNew Year\\'s Day came and passed, but no gift hung on my door; so I made\\nup my mind it was all a mistake, and, being pretty busy about that time,\\nthought no more of the matter till some weeks later, as I came into town\\none day after a visit in the country.\\n\\nI am fond of observing faces, and seldom forget one if anything has\\nparticularly attracted my attention to it. So this morning, as I rode\\nalong, I looked at the conductor, as there was no one else to observe,\\nand he had a pleasant sort of face. Somehow, it looked familiar, and\\nafter thinking idly about it for a minute, I remembered where I had\\nseen it before.\\n\\nHe was the man who waited for \"little missy,\" and I at once began to\\nhope that she would come again, for I wanted to ask about the holidays,\\nremembering how \"fond of fun\" she was.\\n\\nWhen we came to the South End Square, where I met her first, I looked\\nout, expecting to see the little figure running down the wide path\\nagain, and quite willing to wait for it a long time if necessary. But no\\none was to be seen but two boys and a dog. The car did not stop, and\\nthough the conductor looked out that way, his hand was not on the strap,\\nand no smile on his face.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you wait for the little girl now?\" I asked, feeling disappointed\\nat not seeing my pretty friend again.\\n\\n\"I wish I could, ma\\'am,\" answered the man, understanding at once, though\\nof course he did not remember me.\\n\\n\"New rules, perhaps?\" I added, as he did not explain, but stood\\nfingering his punch, and never minding an old lady, wildly waving her\\nbag at him from the sidewalk.\\n\\n\"No, ma\\'am; but it\\'s no use waiting for little missy any more,\\nbecause\"--here he leaned in and said, very low,--\"she is dead;\" then\\nturned sharply round, rung the bell, put the old lady in and shut the\\ndoor.\\n\\nHow grieved I was to have that pleasant friendship end so sadly, for I\\nhad planned many small surprises for my girl, and now I could do no\\nmore, could never know all about her, never see the sunny face again, or\\nwin another word from lips that seemed made for smiling.\\n\\nOnly a little school-girl, yet how many friends she seemed to have,\\nmaking them unconsciously by her gentle manners, generous actions, and\\ninnocent light-heartedness. I could not bear to think what home must be\\nwithout her, for I am sure I was right in believing her a good, sweet\\nchild, because real character shows itself in little things, and the\\nheart that always keeps in tune makes its music heard everywhere.\\n\\nThe busy man of the horse-car found time to miss her, the schoolmates\\nevidently mourned their queen, for when I met them they walked quietly,\\ntalked low, and several wore black bows upon the sleeve; while I,\\nalthough I never knew her name, or learned a single fact about her, felt\\nthe sweetness of her happy nature, and have not yet forgotten my little\\nschool-girl.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX.\\n\\nWHAT A SHOVEL DID.\\n\\n\\nAs my friend stood by the window, watching the \"soft falling snow,\" I\\nsaw him smile,--a thoughtful yet a very happy smile, and, anxious to\\nknow what brought it, I asked,--\\n\\n\"What do you see out there?\"\\n\\n\"Myself,\" was the answer that made me stare in surprise, as I joined him\\nand looked curiously into the street.\\n\\nAll I saw was a man shovelling snow; and, thoroughly puzzled, I turned\\nto Richard, demanding an explanation. He laughed, and answered\\nreadily,--\\n\\n\"While we wait for Kate and the children, I\\'ll tell you a little\\nadventure of mine. It may be useful to you some day.\\n\\n\"Fifteen years ago, on a Sunday morning like this, I stood at the window\\nof a fireless, shabby little room, without one cent in my pocket, and\\nno prospect of getting one.\\n\\n\"I had gone supperless to bed, and spent the long night asking, \\'What\\nshall I do?\\' and, receiving no reply but that which is so hard for eager\\nyouth to accept, \\'Wait and trust.\\'\\n\\n\"I was alone in the world, with no fortune but my own talent, and even\\nthat I was beginning to doubt, because it brought no money. For a year I\\nhad worked and hoped, with a brave spirit; had written my life into\\npoems and tales; tried a play; turned critic and reviewed books; offered\\nmy pen and time to any one who would employ them, and now was ready for\\nthe hardest literary work, and the poorest pay, for starvation stared me\\nin the face.\\n\\n\"All my ventures failed, and my paper boats freighted with so many high\\nhopes, went down one after another, leaving me to despair. The last\\nwreck lay on my table then,--a novel, worn with much journeying to and\\nfro, on which I had staked my last chance, and lost it.\\n\\n\"As I stood there at my window, cold and hungry, solitary and\\ndespairing, I said to myself, in a desperate mood,--\\n\\n\"\\'It is all a mistake; I have no talent, and there is no room in the\\nworld for me, so the quicker I get out of it the better.\\'\\n\\n\"Just then a little chap came from a gate opposite, with a shovel on his\\nshoulder, and trudged away, whistling shrilly, to look for a job. I\\nwatched him out of sight, thinking bitterly,--\\n\\n\"\\'Now look at the injustice of it! Here am I, a young man full of\\nbrains, starving because no one will give me a chance; and there is that\\nignorant little fellow making a living with an old shovel!\\'\"\\n\\nA voice seemed to answer me, saying,--\\n\\n\"\\'Why don\\'t you do the same? If brains don\\'t pay, try muscles, and thank\\nGod that you have health.\\'\\n\\n\"Of course it was only my own pluck and common sense; but I declare to\\nyou I was as much struck by the new idea as if a strange voice _had_\\nactually spoken; and I answered, heartily,--\\n\\n\"\\'As I live I _will_ try it! and not give up while there is any honest\\nwork for these hands to do.\\'\\n\\n\"With sudden energy I put on my shabbiest clothes,--and they were _very_\\nshabby, of course, added an old cap and rough comforter, as disguise,\\nand stole down to the shed where I had seen a shovel. It was early, and\\nthe house was very quiet, for the other lodgers were hard workers all\\nthe week, and took their rest Sunday morning.\\n\\n\"Unseen by the sleepy girl making her fires, I got the shovel and stole\\naway by the back gate, feeling like a boy out on a frolic. It was bitter\\ncold, and a heavy snow-storm had raged all night. The streets were full\\nof drifts, and the city looked as if dead, for no one was stirring yet\\nbut milkmen, and other poor fellows like me, seeking for an early job.\\n\\n\"I made my way to the West End, and was trying to decide at which of the\\ntall houses to apply first, when the door of one opened, and a pretty\\nhousemaid appeared, broom in hand.\\n\\n\"At sight of the snowy wilderness she looked dismayed, and with a few\\nunavailing strokes of her broom at the drift on the steps, was about to\\ngo in, when her eye fell on me.\\n\\n\"My shovel explained my mission, and she beckoned with an imperious wave\\nof her duster to the shabby man opposite. I ploughed across, and\\nreceived in silence the order to--\\n\\n\"\\'Clear them steps and sidewalk, and sweep \\'em nice, for our folks\\nalways go to church, rain or shine.\\'\\n\\n\"Then leaving her broom outside, the maid slammed the door with a\\nshiver, and I fell to work manfully. It was a heavy job, and my hands,\\nunused to any heavier tool than a pen, were soon blistered; but I tugged\\naway, and presently found myself much stimulated by the critical and\\napproving glances bestowed upon me by the pretty girl, taking breakfast\\nin the basement with a buxom cook and a friend, who had evidently\\ndropped in on her way home from early Mass.\\n\\n\"I was a young fellow, and in spite of my late despair, the fun of the\\nthing tickled me immensely, and I laughed behind my old tippet, as I\\nshovelled and swept with a vigor that caused the stout cook to smile\\nupon me.\\n\\n\"When the job was done, and I went to the lower door for my well-earned\\npay, the maid said, with condescension, as she glanced coquettishly at\\nmy ruddy face and eyes that twinkled under the old cap, I suspect,--\\n\\n\"\\'You can wait here while I run up, and get the money, if master is\\nawake.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'Ye haven\\'t the heart of a woman, Mary, to kape the poor crater out\\nthere when it\\'s kilt wid the could he is,\\' said the buxom cook; adding,\\nin a motherly tone, \\'Come in wid yez, my man, and set till the fire, for\\nit\\'s bitter weather the day.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'Faix an\\' it is, ma\\'m, thankin\\' ye kindly,\\' I answered, with a fine\\nbrogue, for as a lad I had played the Irishman with success.\\n\\n\"The good soul warmed to me at once, and, filling a mug with coffee,\\ngave it to me with a hearty--\\n\\n\"\\'A hot sup will do you no harrum, me b\\'y, and sure in the blessid\\nChristmas time that\\'s just fore-ninst us, the master won\\'t begrudge ye a\\nbreakfast; so take a biscuit and a sassage, for it\\'s like ye haven\\'t had\\na mouthful betwixt your lips the day.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'That I will,\\' said I; \\'and it\\'s good luck and a long life to ye I\\'m\\ndrinkin\\' in this illegint coffee.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'Bless the b\\'y! but it\\'s a grateful heart he has, and a blue eye as\\nlike my Pat as two pays,\\' cried the cook, regarding me with increasing\\nfavor, as I bolted the breakfast which I should have been too proud to\\naccept from any hand less humble.\\n\\n\"Here the guest asked a question concerning Pat, and instantly the\\nmother gushed into praises of her boy, telling in a few picturesque\\nwords, as only an Irishwoman could do it, how Pat had come to \\'Ameriky\\'\\nfirst when things went hard with them in the \\'ould country,\\' and how\\ngood he was in sending home his wages till she could join him.\\n\\n\"How she came, but could not find her \\'b\\'y, because of the loss of the\\nletter with his address, and how for a year she waited and watched, sure\\nthat he would find her at last. How the saints had an eye on him, and\\none happy day answered her prayers in a way that she considered \\'aquil\\nto any merrycle ever seen.\\' For, looking up from her work, who should\\nshe see, in a fine livery, sitting on the box of a fine carriage at the\\nmaster\\'s door, but \\'her own b\\'y, like a king in his glory.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'Arrah, ye should have seen me go up thim steps, Katy, and my Pat come\\noff that box like an angel flyin\\', and the way he tuk me in his arms,\\nnever mindin\\' his illigint coat, and me all dirt a-blackin\\' me range.\\nAh\\'r, but I was a happy crayter that day!\\'\\n\\n\"Here the good soul stopped to wipe away the tears that were shining on\\nher fat cheeks, and Mary appeared with a dollar, \\'for master said it was\\na tough job and well done.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'May his bed be aisy above, darlin\\', and many thanks, and the\\ncompliments of the sayson to ye, ladies.\\'\\n\\n\"With which grateful farewell I trudged away, well pleased at the\\nsuccess of my first attempt. Refreshed and cheered by the kindness of my\\nhumble hostess, I took heart, and worked away at my next job with\\nredoubled energy, and by the time the first bells rang for church, I had\\nthree dollars in my pocket. My blood danced in my veins, and all my\\ndespair seemed shovelled away with the snow I had cleared from other\\npeople\\'s paths.\\n\\n\"My back ached, and my palms were sore, but heart and soul were in tune\\nagain, and hurrying home, I dressed and went to church, feeling that a\\nspecial thanksgiving was due for the lesson I had learned.\\n\\n\"Christmas garlands hung upon the walls, Christmas music rolled through\\nthe church, and Christmas sermon, prayer, and psalm cheered the hearts\\nof all. But the shabby young man in the back seat found such beauty and\\ncomfort in the service of that day that he never forgot it, for it was\\nthe turning-point of his life.\"\\n\\nMy friend fell silent for a minute, and I sat, contrasting that past of\\nhis, with the happy present, for he was a prosperous man now, with an\\nhonored name, a comfortable fortune, and best of all, a noble wife, and\\nsome brave lads to follow in his footsteps.\\n\\nPresently I could not resist asking,--\\n\\n\"Did you go on shovelling, Dick?\"\\n\\n\"Not long, for there was no need of it, thanks to Pat\\'s mother,\" he\\nanswered smiling.\\n\\n\"Come, I _must_ have all the story, for I know it has a sequel!\"\\n\\n\"A very happy one. Yes, I owe to that kind soul and her little story,\\nthe turn that Fortune gave her wheel. Nay, rather say, the touch of\\nnature that makes the whole world kin. For when I went home that day, I\\nsat down and made a simple tale from the hint she gave, and something of\\nher own humor and pathos must have got into it, for it was accepted, and\\nmore stories solicited, to my great surprise.\\n\\n\"I wrote it to please myself, for I was in a happy mood; and though my\\nroom was cold, the sun shone; though my closet was bare, honest money\\nwas in my pocket, and I felt as rich as a king.\\n\\n\"I remember I laughed at myself as I posted the manuscript on Monday\\nmorning, called it infatuation, and thought no more of it for days,\\nbeing busy with my new friend, the shovel.\\n\\n\"Snow was gone, but coal remained, and I put in tons of it with a will,\\nfor this active labor was the tonic my overwrought nerves needed, and my\\nspirits rose wonderfully, as muscles earned the daily bread that brains\\nhad failed to win.\\n\\n\"Ah! but they brought me something better than bread, dearer than fame;\\nand to that old shovel I owe the happiness of my life! The very day I\\ngot the letter accepting the little story, I was gaily putting in my\\nlast ton of coal, for I felt that now I might take up the pen again,\\nsince in a kitchen I had discovered the magic that wins listeners.\\n\\n\"Bless my heart! how I worked and how I whistled, I was so happy, and\\nfelt so lifted above all doubt and fear by the knowledge that my talent\\nwas _not_ a failure, and the fact that my own strong arms could keep the\\nwolf from the door!\\n\\n\"I was so busy that I had not observed a lady watching me from the\\nwindow. She had opened it to feed the hungry sparrows, and my whistle\\ncaught her ear, for it was an air she knew, and had heard a certain\\nyoung man sing before he dropped out of her circle, and left her\\nwondering sadly what had befallen him.\\n\\n\"All this I learned afterward; then I unconsciously piped away till my\\njob was done, wiped my hot face, and went in to get my money. To my\\nsurprise I was told to \\'go into the dining room, and missis would\\nattend to it.\\'\\n\\n\"I went and found myself face to face, not with \\'missis,\\' but the woman\\nI had loved hopelessly but faithfully all that hard year, since I had\\ngone away to fight my battle alone.\\n\\n\"For a moment I believed she did not know me, in my shabby suit and\\nbesmirched face. But she did, and with a world of feeling in her own\\nsweet face, she offered me, not money, but her hand, saying in a voice\\nthat made my heart leap up,--\\n\\n\"\\'Richard, I was afraid you had gone down as so many disappointed young\\nmen go when their ambitious hopes fail; but I am so glad, so proud to\\nsee in your face that you still work and wait, like a brave and honest\\nman. I _must_ speak to you!\\'\\n\\n\"What could I do after that but hold the white hand fast in both my\\ngrimy ones, while I told my little story, and the hope that had come at\\nlast. Heaven knows I told it very badly, for those tender eyes were upon\\nme all the time, so full of unspoken love and pity, admiration and\\nrespect, that I felt like one in a glorified dream, and forgot I was a\\ncoal-heaver.\\n\\n\"That was the last of it, though, and the next time I came to see my\\nKate it was with clean hands, that carried her, as a first love-token,\\nthe little tale which was the foundation-stone of this happy home.\"\\n\\nHe stopped there, and his face brightened beautifully, for the sound of\\nlittle feet approached, and childish voices cried eagerly,--\\n\\n\"Papa! papa! the snow has come! May we go and shovel off the steps?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, my lads, and mind you do it well; for some day you may have to\\nearn your breakfast,\" answered Dick, as three fine boys came prancing\\nin, full of delight at the first snow-fall.\\n\\n\"These fellows have a passion for shovelling which they inherit from\\ntheir father,\" he added, with a twinkle of the eye that told Mrs. Kate\\nwhat we had been talking about.\\n\\nIt was sweet to see with what tender pride she took the hand he\\nstretched out to her, and holding it in both her own, said, with her\\neyes upon her boys,--\\n\\n\"I hope they _will_ inherit not only their father\\'s respect for honest\\nwork, but the genius that can see and paint truth and beauty in the\\nhumble things of this world.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXI.\\n\\nCLAMS.\\n\\nA GHOST STORY.\\n\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t a room in the house, ma\\'am, but if you don\\'t mind going down\\nto the cottage, and coming up here to your meals, I can accommodate you,\\nand would be glad to,\" said Mrs. Grant, in answer to my demand for\\nboard.\\n\\n\"Where is the cottage?\" and I looked about me, feeling ready to accept\\nanything in the way of shelter, after the long, hot journey from\\nbroiling Boston, to breezy York Harbor.\\n\\n\"Right down there, just a step, you see. It\\'s all in order, and next\\nweek it will be full, for many folks prefer it because of the quiet.\"\\n\\nAt the end of a precipitous path, which offered every facility for\\naccidents of all sorts, from a sprained ankle to a broken neck, stood\\nthe cottage, a little white building with a pretty woodbine over the\\nporch, gay flowers in the garden, and the blue Atlantic rolling up at\\nthe foot of the cliff.\\n\\n\"A regular \\'Cottage by the Sea.\\' It will suit me exactly if I can have\\nthat front upper room. I don\\'t mind being alone, so have my trunk taken\\ndown, please, and I\\'ll get ready for tea,\" said I, congratulating myself\\non my good luck. Alas, how little I knew what a night of terror I was to\\npass in that picturesque abode!\\n\\nAn hour later, refreshed by my tea and invigorated by the delicious\\ncoolness, I plunged recklessly into the gayeties of the season, and\\naccepted two invitations for the evening,--one to a stroll on Sunset\\nHill, the other to a clam-bake on the beach.\\n\\nThe stroll came first, and while my friend paused at one of the\\nfishily-fragrant houses by the way, to interview her washerwoman, I went\\non to the hill-top, where a nautical old gentleman with a spy-glass,\\nwelcomed me with the amiable remark,--\\n\\n\"Pretty likely place for a prospeck.\"\\n\\nEntering into a conversation with this ancient mariner, I asked if he\\nknew any legend or stories concerning the old houses all about us.\\n\\n\"Sights of \\'em; but it aint allers the _old_ places as has the most\\nstories concernin\\' \\'em. Why, that cottage down yonder aint more \\'n fifty\\nyear old, and they say there\\'s been a lot of ghosts seen there, owin\\' to\\na man\\'s killin\\' of himself in the back bedroom.\"\\n\\n\"What, that house at the end of the lane?\" I asked, with sudden\\ninterest.\\n\\n\"Jes\\' so; nice place, but lonesome and dampish. Ghosts and toadstools is\\napt to locate in houses of that sort,\" placidly responded the venerable\\ntar.\\n\\nThe dampness scared me more than the goblins, for I never saw a ghost\\nyet, but I had been haunted by rheumatism, and found it a hard fiend to\\nexorcise.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve taken a room there, so I\\'m rather interested in knowing what\\ncompany I\\'m to have.\"\\n\\n\"Took a room, hev you? Wal, I dare say you won\\'t be troubled. Some folks\\nhave a knack of seeing sperrits, and then agin some hasn\\'t. My wife is\\nuncommon powerful that way, but I aint; my sight\\'s dreadful poor for\\nthat sort of critter.\"\\n\\nThere was such a sly twinkle in the starboard eye of the old fellow as\\nhe spoke, that I laughed outright, and asked, sociably,--\\n\\n\"Has she ever seen the ghosts of the cottage? I think _I_ have rather a\\nknack that way, and I\\'d like to know what to expect.\"\\n\\n\"No, her sort is the rappin\\' kind. Down yonder the only ghost I take\\nmuch stock in is old Bezee Tucker\\'s. He killed himself in the back\\nbedroom, and some folks say they\\'ve heard him groanin\\' there nights, and\\na drippin\\' sound; he bled to death, you know. It was kep\\' quiet at the\\ntime, and is forgotten now by all but a few old chaps like me. Bezee was\\nallers civil to the ladies, so I guess he won\\'t bother you, ma\\'am;\" and\\nthe old fellow laughed.\\n\\n\"If he does, I\\'ll let you know;\" and with that I departed, for my friend\\ncalled to me that the beach party was clamoring for our company.\\n\\nIn the delights of that festive hour, I forgot the croaking of the\\nancient mariner, for I was about to taste a clam for the first time in\\nmy life, and it was a most absorbing moment. Perched about on the rocks\\nlike hungry penguins, we watched the jovial cooks with breathless\\ninterest, as they struggled with refractory frying-pans, fish that\\nstubbornly refused to brown, steaming seaweed and hot stones.\\n\\nA certain captivating little Margie waited upon me so prettily that I\\nshould have been tempted to try a sea porcupine unskinned if she had\\noffered it, so irresistible was her chirping way of saying, \"Oh, here\\'s\\na perfectly lovely one! Do take him by his little black head and eat him\\nquick.\"\\n\\nSo beguiled, I indulged recklessly in clams, served hot between two\\nshells, little dreaming what a price I was to pay for that marine\\nbanquet.\\n\\nWe kept up till late, and then I was left at my own door by my friend,\\nwho informed me that York was a very primitive, safe place, where people\\nslept with unlocked doors, and nothing ever went amiss o\\'nights.\\n\\nI said nothing of the ghosts, being ashamed to own that I quaked a\\nlittle at the idea of the \"back bedroom,\" as I shut out the friendly\\nfaces and bolted myself in.\\n\\nA lamp and matches stood in the hall, and lighting the lamp, I whisked\\nup stairs with suspicious rapidity, locked my door and retired to bed,\\nfirmly refusing to own even to myself that I had ever heard the name of\\nBezee Tucker.\\n\\nBeing very tired, I soon fell asleep; but fried potatoes and a dozen or\\ntwo of hot clams are not viands best fitted to insure quiet repose, so a\\nfit of nightmare brought me to a realizing sense of my indiscretion.\\n\\nFrom a chaos of wild dreams was finally evolved a gigantic clam, whose\\nmission it was to devour me as I had devoured its relatives. The sharp\\nshells gaped before me, a solemn voice said, \"Take her by her little\\nhead and eat her quick.\" Retribution was at hand, and, with a despairing\\neffort to escape by diving, I bumped my head smartly against the wall,\\nand woke up feeling as if there was an earthquake under the bed.\\n\\nCollecting my scattered wits, I tried to compose myself to slumber\\nagain; but alas! that fatal feast had murdered sleep, and I vainly tried\\nto lull my wakeful senses with the rustle of woodbine leaves about the\\nwindow, and the breaking waves upon the beach.\\n\\nIn one of the pauses between the ebb and flow of the waves, I heard a\\ncurious sound in the house,--a muffled sort of moan, coming at regular\\nintervals. And, as I sat up to make out where it was, another sound\\ncaught my attentive ear. Drip, drip, drip, went something out in the\\nhall, and in an instant the tale told me on Sunset Hill came back with\\nunpleasant vividness.\\n\\n\"Nonsense! it is raining, and the roof leaks,\" I said to myself, while a\\ndisagreeable thrill went through me, and fancy, aided by indigestion,\\nbegan to people the house with uncanny inmates.\\n\\nNo rain had fallen for weeks, and peeping through my curtain I saw the\\nbig, bright stars shining in a cloudless sky; so that explanation\\nfailed, and still the drip, drip, drip went on. Likewise the moaning, so\\ndistinctly now that it was evident the little back bedroom was next the\\nchamber in which I was quaking at that identical moment.\\n\\n\"Some one is sleeping there,\" I said, and then recollected that all the\\nrooms were locked, and all the keys but mine in Mrs. Grant\\'s pocket up\\nat the house.\\n\\n\"Well, let the goblins enjoy themselves; I won\\'t disturb them if they\\nlet me alone. Some of the ladies thought me brave to dare to sleep here,\\nand it will never do to own I was scared by a foolish story and an odd\\nsound.\"\\n\\nSo down I lay, and said the multiplication table industriously for\\nseveral minutes, trying to turn a deaf ear to the outer world, and curb\\nmy unruly thoughts. But it was a failure, and, when I found myself\\nsaying over and over \"Four times twelve is twenty-four,\" I gave up\\naffecting courage, and went in for a good honest scare.\\n\\nAs a cheerful subject for midnight meditation I kept thinking of B.\\nTucker, in spite of every effort to abstain. In vain I recalled the fact\\nthat the departed gentleman was \"allers civil to the ladies.\" I still\\nwas in mortal fear lest he might think it necessary to come and\\napologize in person for \"bothering\" me.\\n\\nPresently a clock struck three, and I involuntarily gave a groan that\\nbeat the ghost\\'s all hollow, so full of anguish was I at the thought of\\nseveral hours of weary waiting in such awesome suspense.\\n\\nI was not sure at what time the daylight would appear, and bitterly\\nregretted not gathering useful information about sunrise, tides, and\\nsuch things, instead of listening to the foolish gossip of Uncle Peter\\non the hill-top.\\n\\nMinute after minute dragged slowly on, and I was just thinking that I\\nshould be obliged to shout \"Fire!\" as the only means of relief in my\\npower, when a stealthy step under the window gave me a new sensation.\\n\\nThis was a start, not a scare, for the new visitor was a human foe, and\\nI had little fear of such, being possessed of good lungs, strong arms,\\nand a Roman dagger nearly as big as a carving-knife. That step broke the\\nspell, and, creeping noiselessly to the window, I peeped out to see a\\ndark figure coming up the stem of the tall tree close by, hand over\\nhand, like a sailor or a monkey.\\n\\n\"Two can play at that game, my friend; you scare me, and I\\'ll scare\\nyou;\" and with an actual sense of relief in breaking the oppressive\\nsilence, I suddenly flung up the curtain, and, leaning out, brandished\\nmy dagger with what I intended to be an awe-inspiring screech, but,\\nowing to the flutter of my breath, the effort ended in a curious\\nmixture of howl and bray.\\n\\nA most effective sound nevertheless; for the rascal dropped as if shot,\\nand, with one upward glance at the white figure dimly seen in the\\nstarlight, fled as if a legion of goblins were at his heels.\\n\\n\"What next?\" thought I, wondering whether tragedy or comedy would close\\nthis eventful night.\\n\\nI sat and waited, chilly, but valiant, while the weird sounds went on\\nwithin, and silence reigned without, till the cheerful crow of the\\npunctual \"cockadoo,\" as Margie called him, announced the dawn and laid\\nthe ghosts. A red glow in the east banished my last fear, and, wrapping\\nthe drapery of my couch about me, I soon lay down to quiet slumber,\\nquite worn out.\\n\\nThe sun shining in my face waked me; a bell ringing spasmodically warned\\nme to hurry, and a childish voice calling out, \"Bet-fast is most weady,\\nMiss Wee,\" assured me that sweet little spirits haunted the cottage as\\nwell as ghostly ones.\\n\\nAs I left my room to join Margie, who was waiting in the porch, and\\nlooking like a rosy morning-glory half-way up the woodbine trellis, I\\nsaw two things which caused me to feel that the horrors of the night\\nwere not all imaginary.\\n\\nJust outside the back bedroom door was a damp place, as if that part of\\nthe floor had been newly washed; and when, goaded by curiosity, I peeped\\nthrough the keyhole of the haunted chamber, my eye distinctly saw an\\nopen razor lying on a dusty table.\\n\\nMy vision was limited to that one object, but it was quite enough, and I\\nwent up the hill brooding darkly over the secret hidden in my breast. I\\nlonged to tell some one, but was ashamed, and, when asked why so pale\\nand absent-minded, I answered, with a gloomy smile,--\\n\\n\"It is the clams.\"\\n\\nAll day I hid my sufferings pretty well, but as night approached, and I\\nthought of another lonely vigil in the haunted cottage, my heart began\\nto fail, and, when we sat telling stories in the dusk, a brilliant idea\\ncame into my head.\\n\\nI would relate my ghost story, and rouse the curiosity of the listeners\\nto such a pitch that some of them would offer to share my quarters, in\\nhopes of seeing the spirit of the restless Tucker.\\n\\nCheered by this delusive fancy, when my turn came I made a thrilling\\ntale of the night\\'s adventures, and, having worked my audience up to a\\nflattering state of excitement, paused for applause.\\n\\nIt came in a most unexpected form, however, for Mrs. Grant burst out\\nlaughing, and the two boys, Johnny and Joe, rolled off the piazza in\\nconvulsions of merriment.\\n\\nMuch disgusted at this unseemly demonstration, I demanded the cause of\\nit, and involuntarily joined in the general shout when Mrs. Grant\\ndemolished my ghost by informing me that Bezee Tucker lived, died in,\\nand haunted the tumble-down house at the _other_ end of the lane.\\n\\n\"Then who or what made those mysterious noises?\" I asked, relieved but\\nrather nettled at the downfall of my romance.\\n\\n\"My brother Seth,\" replied Mrs. Grant, still laughing. \"I thought you\\nmight be afraid to be there all alone, so he slipped into the bedroom,\\nand I forgot to tell you. He\\'s a powerful snorer, and that\\'s one of the\\nawful sounds. The other was the dripping of salt water; for you wanted\\nsome, and the girl got it in a leaky pail. Seth wiped up the slops when\\nhe came out early in the morning.\"\\n\\nI said nothing about the keyhole view of the harmless razor, but,\\nfeeling that I did deserve some credit for my heroic reception of the\\nburglar, I mildly asked if it was the custom in York for men as well as\\nturkeys to roost in trees.\\n\\nAn explosion from the boys extinguished my last hope of glory, for as\\nsoon as he could speak Joe answered, unable to resist the joke, though\\ntelling it betrayed his own transgressions.\\n\\n\"Johnny planned to be up awful early, and pick the last cherries off\\nthat tree. I wanted to get ahead of him, so I sneaked down before light\\nto humbug him, for I was going a-fishing, and we have to be off by\\nfour.\"\\n\\n\"Did you get your cherries?\" I asked, bound to have some of the laugh on\\nmy side.\\n\\n\"Guess I didn\\'t,\" grumbled Joe, rubbing his knees, while Johnny added,\\nwith an exulting chuckle,--\\n\\n\"He got a horrid scare and a right good scraping, for he didn\\'t know any\\none was down there. Couldn\\'t go fishing either, he was so lame, and I\\nhad the cherries after all. Served him right, didn\\'t it?\"\\n\\nNo answer was necessary, for the two lads indulged in a friendly scuffle\\namong the hay-cocks, while Mrs. Grant went off to repeat the tale in the\\nkitchen, whence the sound of a muffled roar soon assured me that Seth\\nwas enjoying the joke as well as the rest of us.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXII.\\n\\nKITTY\\'S CATTLE SHOW.\\n\\n\\nLittle Kitty was an orphan, and she lived in the poor-house, where she\\nran errands, tended babies, and was everybody\\'s servant. A droll,\\nhappy-hearted child, who did her best to be good, and was never tired of\\nhoping that something pleasant would happen.\\n\\nShe had often heard of Cattle Shows, but had never been to one, though\\nshe lived in a town where there was one every year.\\n\\nAs October came, and people began to get ready for the show, Kitty was\\nseized with a strong desire to go, and asked endless questions about it\\nof old Sam, who lived in the house.\\n\\n\"Did you say anybody could go in for nothing if they took something to\\nshow?\" she asked.\\n\\n\"Yes; and them that has the best fruit, or cows, or butter, or whatever\\nit is, they gets a premium,\" said Sam, chopping away.\\n\\n\"What\\'s a primmynum?\" asked Kitty, forgetting to pick up chips, in her\\ninterest.\\n\\n\"It\\'s money; some gets a lot, and some only a dollar, or so.\"\\n\\n\"I wish I had something nice to show, but I don\\'t own anything but\\npuss,\" and the little girl stroked the plump, white kitten that was\\nfrisking all over her.\\n\\n\"Better send her; she\\'s pretty enough to fetch a prize anywheres,\" said\\nSam, who was fond of both Kittys.\\n\\n\"Do they have cats there?\" asked the child, soberly.\\n\\n\"Ought to, if they don\\'t, for, if cats aint cattle, I don\\'t see what\\nthey be,\" and old Sam laughed, as if he had made a joke.\\n\\n\"I mean to take her and see the show, any way, for that will be\\nsplendid, even if she don\\'t get any money! O, puss, will you go, and\\nbehave well, and get a primmynum for me, so I can buy a book of\\nstories?\" cried Kitty, upsetting her basket in her sudden skip at the\\nfine plan.\\n\\nPuss turned a somersault, raced after a chicken, and then rushed up her\\nmistress\\' back, and, perching demurely on her shoulder, peeped into her\\nface, as if asking if pranks like these wouldn\\'t win a prize anywhere.\\n\\n\"You are going to take Mr. Green\\'s hens for him; can\\'t I go with you? I\\nwon\\'t be any trouble, and I do so want to see the fun,\" added Kitty,\\nafter thinking over her plan a few minutes.\\n\\nNow, Sam meant to take her, but had not told her so yet, and now, being\\na waggish old fellow, he thought he would let her take her cat, for the\\njoke of it, so he said soberly,--\\n\\n\"Yes, I\\'ll tuck you in somewheres, and you\\'d better put puss into the\\nblackbird\\'s old cage, else she will get scared, and run away. You stand\\nit among the chicken-coops, and folks will admire her, I aint a doubt.\"\\n\\nInnocent little Kitty was in raptures at the prospect, though the people\\nin the house laughed at her. But she firmly believed it was all right,\\nand made her preparations with solemn care.\\n\\nThe old cage was scrubbed till the wires shone, then she trimmed it up\\nwith evergreen, and put a bed of scarlet leaves for snowy puss to lie\\non. Puss was washed, and combed, and decked with a blue bow on the grand\\nday, and, when she had been persuaded to enter her pretty prison, the\\neffect was charming.\\n\\nA happier little lass was seldom seen than Kitty when, dressed in her\\nclean, blue check frock, and the old hat, with a faded ribbon, she rode\\naway with Sam; and behind, among the hen-coops, was Miss Puss, much\\nexcited by the clucking and fluttering of her fellow-travellers.\\n\\nWhen the show grounds were reached, Kitty thought the bustle and the\\nnoise quite as interesting as the cattle; and when, after putting his\\npoultry in its place, Sam led her up into the great hall where the fruit\\nand flowers were, she began to imagine that the fairy tales were coming\\ntrue.\\n\\nWhile she stood staring at some very astonishing worsted-work pictures,\\na lady, who was arranging fruit near by, upset a basket of fine peaches,\\nand they rolled away under tables and chairs.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll pick \\'em up, ma\\'am,\" cried Kitty, who loved to be useful; and down\\nshe went on her hands and knees, and carefully picked up every runaway.\\n\\n\"What is your name, my obliging little girl?\" asked the lady, as she\\nbrushed up the last yellow peach.\\n\\n\"Kitty; and I live at the poor-house; and I never saw a Cattle Show\\nbefore, \\'cause I didn\\'t have any thing to bring,\" said the child,\\nfeeling as important with her cat as a whole agricultural society.\\n\\n\"What did you bring,--patchwork?\"\\n\\n\"O, no, ma\\'am, a lovely cat, and she is down stairs with the hens,--all\\nwhite, with blue eyes and a blue bow,\" cried Kitty.\\n\\n\"I want to see her,\" said a little girl, popping her head up from behind\\nthe table, where she had bashfully hidden from the stranger.\\n\\nThe lady consented, and the children went away together.\\n\\nWhile they were gone, Sam came to find his little friend, and the kind\\nlady, amused at the cat story, asked about the child.\\n\\n\"She aint no friends but me and the kitten, so I thought I\\'d give the\\npoor little soul a bit of pleasure. The quarter I\\'ll get for fetching\\nGreen\\'s hens will get Kitty some dinner, and a book maybe, or something\\nto remember Cattle Show by. Shouldn\\'t wonder if I earned a trifle more\\ndoing chores round to-day; if so, I shall give it to her for a premium,\\n\\'cause I fetched the cat for fun, and wouldn\\'t like to disappoint the\\nchild.\"\\n\\nAs Sam laughed, and rubbed his rough hands over the joke of surprising\\nKitty, the lady looked at his kind old face, and resolved to give him a\\npleasure, too, and of the sort he liked.\\n\\nShe was rich and generous, and, when her little girl came back, begging\\nher to buy the lovely kitten, she said she would, and put five dollars\\ninto Sam\\'s hands, telling him that was Kitty\\'s premium, to be used in\\nbuying clothes and comforts for the motherless child.\\n\\nKitty was quite willing to sell puss, for five dollars seemed a splendid\\nfortune to her. Such a happy day as that was, for she saw everything,\\nhad a good dinner, bought \"Babes in the Wood\" of a peddler, and, best of\\nall, made friends.\\n\\nMiss Puss was brought up by her new mistress, and put on a table among\\nthe flowers, where the pretty cage and the plump, tricksy kitten\\nattracted much attention, for the story was told, and the little girl\\'s\\ndroll contribution much laughed over.\\n\\nBut the poor-house people didn\\'t laugh, for they were so surprised and\\ndelighted at this unexpected success that they were never tired of\\ntalking about Kitty\\'s Cattle Show.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXIII.\\n\\nWHAT BECOMES OF THE PINS.\\n\\n\\nMiss Ellen was making a new pincushion, and a very pretty one it\\npromised to be, for she had much taste, and spent half her time\\nembroidering chair-covers, crocheting tidies, and all sorts of dainty\\ntrifles. Her room was full of them; and she often declared that she did\\nwish some one would invent a new sort of fancy-work, since she had tried\\nall the old kinds till she was tired of them. Painting china, carving\\nwood, button-holing butterflies and daisies onto Turkish towelling, and\\nmaking peacock-feather trimming, amused her for a time; but as she was\\nnot very successful she soon gave up trying these branches, and wondered\\nif she would not take a little plain sewing for a change.\\n\\nThe old cushion stood on her table beside the new one; which was ready\\nfor its trimming of lace and ribbon. A row of delicate new pins also lay\\nwaiting to adorn the red satin mound, and in the old blue one still\\nremained several pins that had evidently seen hard service.\\n\\nMiss Ellen was putting a dozen needles into her book, having just picked\\nthem out of the old cushion, and, as she quilted them through the\\nflannel leaves, she said half aloud,--\\n\\n\"It is very evident where the needles go, but I really do wish I knew\\nwhat becomes of the pins.\"\\n\\n\"I can tell you,\" answered a small, sharp voice, as a long brass pin\\ntried to straighten itself up in the middle of a faded blue cornflower,\\nevidently prepared to address the meeting.\\n\\nMiss Ellen stared much surprised, for she had used this big pin a good\\ndeal lately, but never heard it speak before. As she looked at it she\\nsaw for the first time that its head had a tiny face, with silvery hair,\\ntwo merry eyes, and a wee mouth out of which came the metallic little\\nvoice that pierced her ear, small as it was.\\n\\n\"Dear me!\" she said; then added politely, \"if you can tell I should be\\nvery happy to hear, for it has long been a great mystery, and no one\\ncould explain it.\"\\n\\nThe old pin tried to sit erect, and the merry eye twinkled as it went on\\nlike a garrulous creature, glad to talk after long silence:--\\n\\n\"Men make many wonderful discoveries, my dear, but they have never found\\nthat out, and never will, because we belong to women, and only a\\nfeminine ear can hear us, a feminine mind understand our mission, or\\nsympathize with our trials, experiences, and triumphs. For we have all\\nthese as well as human beings, and there really is not much difference\\nbetween us when we come to look into the matter.\"\\n\\nThis was such a curious statement that Miss Ellen forgot her work to\\nlisten intently, and all the needles fixed their eyes on the audacious\\npin. Not a whit abashed it thus continued:--\\n\\n\"I am called \\'Granny\\' among my friends, because I have had a long and\\neventful life. I am hearty and well, however, in spite of this crick in\\nmy back, and hope to serve you a good while yet, for you seem to\\nappreciate me, stout and ordinary as I look.\\n\\n\"Yes, my dear, pins and people _are_ alike, and that rusty\\ndarning-needle need not stare so rudely, for I shall prove what I say.\\nWe are divided into classes by birth and constitution, and each can do\\nmuch in its own sphere. I am a shawl pin, and it would be foolish in me\\nto aspire to the duties of those dainty lace pins made to fasten a\\ncollar. I am contented with my lot, however, and, being of a strong make\\nand enterprising spirit, have had many adventures, some perils, and\\ngreat satisfactions since I left the factory long ago. I well remember\\nhow eagerly I looked about me when the paper in which I lived, with some\\nhundreds of relations, was hung up in a shop window, to display our\\nglittering ranks and tempt people to buy. At last a purchaser came, a\\ndashing young lady who bought us with several other fancy articles, and\\ncarried us away in a smart little bag, humming and talking to herself,\\nin what I thought a very curious way.\\n\\n\"When we were taken out I was all in a flutter to see where I was and\\nwhat would happen next. There were so many of us, I could hardly hope to\\ngo first, for I was in the third row, and most people take us in order.\\nBut Cora was a hasty, careless soul, and pulled us out at random, so I\\nsoon found myself stuck up in a big untidy cushion, with every sort of\\npin you can imagine. Such a gay and giddy set I never saw, and really,\\nmy dear, their ways and conversation were quite startling to an ignorant\\nyoung thing like me. Pearl, coral, diamond, jet, gold, and silver heads,\\nwere all around me as well as vulgar brass knobs, jaunty black pins,\\ngood for nothing as they snap at the least strain, and my own relations,\\nlooking eminently neat and respectable among this theatrical rabble. For\\nI will not disguise from you, Miss Ellen, that my first mistress was an\\nactress, and my life a very gay one at the beginning. Merry, kind, and\\ncareless was the pretty Cora, and I am bound to confess I enjoyed myself\\nimmensely, for I was taken by chance with half a dozen friends to pin up\\nthe folds of her velvet train and mantle, in a fairy spectacle where she\\nplayed the queen. It was very splendid, and, snugly settled among the\\nsoft folds, I saw it all, and probably felt that I too had my part;\\nhumble as it was, it was faithfully performed, and I never once deserted\\nmy post for six weeks.\\n\\n\"Among the elves who went flitting about with silvery wings and spangled\\nrobes was one dear child who was the good genius of the queen, and was\\nalways fluttering near her, so I could not help seeing and loving the\\ndear creature. She danced and sung, came out of flowers, swung down from\\ntrees, popped up from the lower regions, and finally, when all the\\nqueen\\'s troubles are over, flew away on a golden cloud, smiling through\\na blaze of red light, and dropping roses as she vanished.\\n\\n\"When the play ended, I used to see her in an old dress, a thin shawl,\\nand shabby hat, go limping home with a tired-looking woman who dressed\\nthe girls.\\n\\n\"I thought a good deal about \\'Little Viola,\\' as they called her,--though\\nher real name was Sally, I believe,--and one dreadful night I played a\\nheroic part, and thrill now when I remember it.\"\\n\\n\"Go on, please, I long to know,\" said Miss Ellen, dropping the\\nneedle-book into her lap, and leaning forward to listen better.\\n\\n\"One evening the theatre took fire,\" continued the old pin impressively.\\n\"I don\\'t know how, but all of a sudden there was a great uproar, smoke,\\nflames, water pouring, people running frantically about, and such a wild\\npanic I lost my small wits for a time. When I recovered them, I found\\nCora was leaning from a high window, with something wrapped closely in\\nthe velvet mantle that I pinned upon the left shoulder just under a\\npaste buckle that only sparkled while _I_ did all the work.\\n\\n\"A little golden head lay close by me, and a white face looked up from\\nthe crimson folds, but the sweet eyes were shut, the lips were drawn\\nwith pain, a horrible odor of burnt clothes came up to me, and the small\\nhand that clutched Cora\\'s neck was all blistered with the cruel fire\\nwhich would have devoured the child if my brave mistress had not rescued\\nher at the risk of her own life. _She_ could have escaped at first, but\\nshe heard Sally cry to her through the blinding smoke, and went to find\\nand rescue her. I dimly recalled that, and pressed closer to the white\\nshoulder, full of pride and affection for the kind soul whom I had often\\nthought too gay and giddy to care for anything but pleasure.\\n\\n\"Now she was calling to the people in the street to put up a ladder,\\nand, as she leaned and called, I could see the crowds far down, the\\nsmoke and flame bursting out below, and hear the hiss of water as it\\nfell upon the blazing walls. It was a most exciting moment, as we hung\\nthere, watching the gallant men fix the long ladder, and one come\\nclimbing up till we could see his brave face, and hear him shout\\ncheerily,--\\n\\n\"\\'Swing from the window-sill, I\\'ll catch you.\\'\\n\\n\"But Cora answered, as she showed the little yellow head that shone in\\nthe red glare,--\\n\\n\"\\'No, save the child first!\\'\\n\\n\"\\'Drop her then, and be quick: it\\'s hot work here,\\' and the man held up\\nhis arms with a laugh, as the flames licked out below as if to eat away\\nthe frail support he stood on.\\n\\n\"All in one breathless moment, Cora had torn off the mantle, wrapped the\\nchild in it, bound her girdle about it, and finding the gaudy band would\\nnot tie, caught out the first pin that came to hand, and fastened it.\\n_I_ was that pin; and I felt that the child\\'s life almost depended upon\\nme, for as the precious bundle dropped into the man\\'s hands he caught it\\nby the cloak, and, putting it on his shoulder, went swiftly down. The\\nbelt strained, the velvet tore, I felt myself bending with the weight,\\nand expected every minute to see the child slip, and fall on the stones\\nbelow. But I held fast, I drove my point deeply in, I twisted myself\\nround so that even the bend should be a help, and I called to the man,\\n\\'Hold tight, I\\'m trying my best, but what can one pin do!\\'\\n\\n\"Of course he did not hear me, but I really believe my desperate efforts\\nwere of some use; for, we got safely down, and were hurried away to the\\nhospital where other poor souls had already gone.\\n\\n\"The good nurse who undid that scorched, drenched, and pitiful bundle,\\nstuck me in her shawl, and resting there, I saw the poor child laid in a\\nlittle bed, her burns skilfully cared for, and her scattered senses\\nrestored by tender words and motherly kisses. How glad I was to hear\\nthat she would live, and still more rejoiced to learn next day that Cora\\nwas near by, badly burned but not in danger, and anxious to see the\\nchild she had saved.\\n\\n\"Nurse Benson took the little thing in her arms to visit my poor\\nmistress, and I went too. But alas! I never should have known the gay\\nand blooming girl of the day before. Her face and hands were terribly\\nburnt, and she would never again be able to play the lovely queen on any\\nstage, for her fresh beauty was forever lost.\\n\\n\"Hard days for all of us; I took my share of trouble with the rest,\\nthough I only suffered from the strain to my back. Nurse Benson\\nstraightened me out and kept me in use, so I saw much of pain and\\npatience in that great house, because the little gray shawl which I\\nfastened covered a tender heart, and on that motherly bosom many aching\\nheads found rest, many weary creatures breathed their last, and more\\nthan one unhappy soul learned to submit.\\n\\n\"Among these last was poor Cora, for it was very hard to give up beauty,\\nhealth, and the life she loved, so soon. Yet I do not think she ever\\nregretted the sacrifice when she saw the grateful child well and safe,\\nfor little Sally was her best comforter, and through the long weeks she\\nlay there half blind and suffering, the daily visit of the little one\\ncheered her more than anything else. The poor mother was lost in the\\ngreat fire, and Cora adopted the orphan as her own, and surely she had a\\nright to what she had so dearly bought.\\n\\n\"They went away together at last, one quite well and strong again, the\\nother a sad wreck, but a better woman for the trial, I think, and she\\ncarried comfort with her. Poor little Sally led her, a faithful guide, a\\ntender nurse, a devoted daughter to her all her life.\"\\n\\nHere the pin paused, out of breath, and Miss Ellen shook a bright drop\\noff the lace that lay in her lap, as she said in a tone of real\\ninterest,--\\n\\n\"What happened next? How long did you stay in the hospital?\"\\n\\n\"I stayed a year, for Nurse used me one day to pin up a print at the\\nfoot of a poor man\\'s bed, and he took such comfort in it they let it\\nhang till he died. A lovely picture of a person who held out his arms to\\nall the suffering and oppressed, and they gathered about him to be\\ncomforted and saved. The forlorn soul had led a wicked life, and now lay\\ndying a long and painful death, but something in that divine face taught\\nhim to hope for pardon, and when no eye but mine saw him in the lonely\\nnights he wept, and prayed, and struggled to repent. I think he was\\nforgiven, for when at last he lay dead a smile was on his lips that\\nnever had been there before. Then the print was taken down, and I was\\nused to pin up a bundle of red flannel by one of the women, and for\\nmonths I lay in a dark chest, meditating on the lessons I had already\\nlearned.\\n\\n\"Suddenly I was taken out, and when a queer round pin-ball of the\\nflannel had been made by a nice old lady, I was stuck in it with a party\\nof fat needles, and a few of my own race, all with stout bodies and big\\nheads.\\n\\n\"\\'The dear boy is clumsy with his fingers, and needs strong things to\\nuse,\\' said the old lady, as she held the tomato cushion in both hands\\nand kissed it before she put it into a soldier\\'s \\'comfort bag.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'Now I shall have a lively time!\\' I thought, and looked gaily about me,\\nfor I liked adventures, and felt that I was sure of them now.\\n\\n\"I cannot begin to tell you all I went through with that boy, for he was\\nbrave as a lion and got many hard knocks. We marched, and camped, and\\nfought, and suffered, but we _never_ ran away, and when at last a Minie\\nball came smashing through the red cushion (which Dick often carried in\\nhis pocket as a sort of charm to keep him safe, for men seldom use\\npins), I nearly lost my head, for the stuffing flew out, and we were all\\nknocked about in a dreadful way. The cushion and the old wallet together\\nsaved Dick\\'s life, however, for the ball did not reach his brave heart,\\nand the last I saw of him as I fell out of the hasty hand that felt for\\na wound was a soft look in the brave bright eyes, as he said to himself\\nwith a smile,--\\n\\n\"\\'Dear old mother hasn\\'t lost her boy yet, thank God!\\'\\n\\n\"A colored lad picked me up, as I lay shining on the grass, and pins\\nbeing scarce in those parts, gave me to his mammy, who kept me to fasten\\nher turban. Quite a new scene I found, for in the old cabin were a dozen\\nchildren and their mothers making ready to go North. The men were all\\naway fighting or serving the army, so mammy led the little troop, and\\nthey marched off one day following the gay turban like a banner, for she\\nhad a valiant soul, and was bound to find safety and freedom for her\\nchildren at all risks.\\n\\n\"In my many wanderings to and fro, I never made so strange a journey as\\nthat one, but I enjoyed it, full of danger, weariness and privation as\\nit was; and every morning when mammy put on the red and yellow\\nhandkerchief I was proud to sit aloft on that good gray head, and lead\\nthe forlorn little army toward a land of liberty.\\n\\n\"We got there at last, and she fell to work over a washtub to earn the\\nbread for the hungry mouths. I had stood by her through all those weary\\nweeks, and did not want to leave her now, but went off pinning a paper\\nround some clean clothes on a Saturday morning.\\n\\n\"\\'Now I wonder what will come next!\\' I thought, as Thomas Jefferson, or\\n\\'Jeff,\\' as they called him, went whistling away with the parcel through\\nthe streets.\\n\\n\"Crossing the park, he spied a lovely butterfly which had strayed in\\nfrom the country; caught and pinned it on his hat to please little Dinah\\nwhen he got home. The pretty creature soon writhed its delicate life\\naway, but its beauty attracted the eye of a pale girl hurrying along\\nwith a roll of work under her arm.\\n\\n\"\\'Will you sell me that?\\' she asked, and Jeff gladly consented,\\nwondering what she would do with it. So did I, but when we got to her\\nroom I soon saw, for she pinned the impaled butterfly against a bit of\\nblue paper, and painted it so well that its golden wings seemed to\\nquiver as they did in life. A very poor place it was, but full of lovely\\nthings, and I grew artistic with just looking about me at the pictures\\non the walls, the flowers blooming on plates and panels, birds and\\ninsects kept for copies, and gay bits of stuff used as back-grounds.\\n\\n\"But more beautiful than anything she made was the girl\\'s quiet, busy\\nlife alone in the big city; for, she was hoping to be an artist, and\\nworked day and night to compass her desire. So poor, but so happy, I\\nused to wonder why no one helped her and kept her from such hard, yet\\npatient, waiting. But no one did, and I could watch her toiling away as\\nI held the butterfly against the wall, feeling as if it was a symbol of\\nherself, beating her delicate wings in that close place till her heart\\nwas broken, by the cruel fate that held her there when she should have\\nbeen out in the free sunshine. But she found a good customer for her\\npretty work, in a rich lady who had nothing to do but amuse herself, and\\nspent much time and money in fancy-work.\\n\\n\"I know all about it; for, one day an order came from the great store\\nwhere her designs were often bought, and she was very happy painting\\nsome purple pansies upon velvet, and she copied her yellow butterfly to\\nfloat above them.\\n\\n\"The poor insect was very dry, and crumbled at a touch, so my task there\\nwas done, and as my mistress rolled up the packet, she took me to fasten\\nit securely, singing as she did so, for every penny was precious.\\n\\n\"We all went together to the rich lady, and she embroidered the flowers\\non a screen very like that one yonder. I thought she would throw me\\naway, I was so battered now, but she took a fancy to use me in various\\nways about her canvas work, and I lived with her all winter. A kind\\nlady, my dear, but I often wished I could suggest to her better ways of\\nspending her life than everlasting fancy-work. She never seemed to see\\nthe wants of those about her, never lent an ear to the poor, or found\\ndelight in giving of her abundance to those who had little, to brighten\\ntheir lives; but sighed because she had nothing to do when the world was\\nfull of work, and she blessed with so many good gifts to use and to\\nenjoy. I hope she will see her mistake some day, and not waste all her\\nlife on trifles, else she will regret it sadly by and by.\"\\n\\nHere the pin paused with a keen glance at Miss Ellen, who had suddenly\\nbegun to sew with a bright color in her cheeks, for the purple pansies\\nwere on the screen that stood before her fire-place, and she recognized\\nthe portrait of herself in that last description. But she did not fancy\\nbeing lectured by a pin, so she asked with a smile as she plaited up her\\nlace,--\\n\\n\"That is all very interesting, but you have not yet told me what becomes\\nof the pins, Granny.\"\\n\\n\"Pins, like people, shape their own lives, in a great measure, my dear,\\nand go to their reward when they are used up. The good ones sink into\\nthe earth and turn to silver, to come forth again in a new and precious\\nform. The bad ones crumble away to nothing in cracks and dust heaps,\\nwith no hope of salvation, unless some human hand lifts them up and\\ngives them a chance to try again. Some are lazy, and slip out of sight\\nto escape service, some are too sharp, and prick and scratch wherever\\nthey are. Others are poor, weak things, who bend up and lose their heads\\nas soon as they are used. Some obtrude themselves on all occasions, and\\nsome are never to be found in times of need. All have the choice to wear\\nout or to rust out. I chose the former, and have had a useful, happy\\nlife so far. I\\'m not as straight as I once was, but I\\'m bright still, my\\npoint is sharp, my head firm, and age has not weakened me much, I hope,\\nbut made me wiser, better, and more contented to do my duty wherever I\\nam, than when I left my native paper long ago.\"\\n\\nBefore Miss Ellen could express her respect for the worthy old pin, a\\ndismal groan was heard from the blue cushion, and a small voice croaked\\naloud,--\\n\\n\"Alas, alas, I chose to rust out, and here I am, a miserable, worthless\\nthing, whom no one can use or care for. Lift the ruffle, and behold a\\nsad contrast to the faithful, honest, happy Granny, who has told us such\\na varied tale.\"\\n\\n\"Bless me, what possesses everything to-day!\" exclaimed Miss Ellen,\\nlooking under the frill of the old cushion to see who was speaking now.\\nThere to be sure she found a pin hidden away, and so rusty that she\\ncould hardly pull it out. But it came creaking forth at the third tug,\\nand when it was set up beside Granny, she cried out in her cheery way,--\\n\\n\"Try Dr. Emery, he can cure most cases of rust, and it is never too late\\nto mend, neighbor.\"\\n\\n\"Too late for me!\" sighed the new comer. \"The rust of idleness has eaten\\ninto my vitals while I lay in my silken bed, and my chance is gone\\nforever. I was bright, and strong, and sharp once, but I feared work and\\nworry, and I hid, growing duller, dimmer, and more useless every day. I\\nam good for nothing, throw me away, and let the black pins mourn for a\\nwasted life.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Miss Ellen, \"you are not useless, for you two shall sit\\ntogether in my new cushion, a warning to me, as well as to the other\\npins, to choose the right way in time, and wear out with doing our duty,\\nrather than rust out as so many do. Thank you, Granny, for your little\\nlecture. I will not forget it, but go at once and find that poor girl,\\nand help her all I can. Rest here, you good old soul, and teach these\\nlittle things to follow your example.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke, Miss Ellen set the two pins in the middle of the red satin\\ncushion, stuck the smaller pins round them, and hastened to put on her\\nshawl lest something should prevent her from going.\\n\\n\"Take me with you; I\\'m not tired, I love to work! use me, dear mistress,\\nand let me help in the good work!\" cried Granny, with a lively skip that\\nsent her out upon the bureau.\\n\\nSo Miss Ellen pinned her shawl with the old pin instead of the fine\\nbrooch she had in her hand, and they went gaily away together, leaving\\nthe rusty one to bemoan itself, and all the little ones to privately\\nresolve that they would not hide away from care and labor, but take\\ntheir share bravely and have a good record to show when they went, at\\nlast where the good pins go.\\n\\nTHE END.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\nLOUISA M.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\npeople in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\\n\\n\\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\\nFoundation\\n\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\n\\nThe Foundation\\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\\ninformation can be found at the Foundation\\'s web site and official\\npage at http://pglaf.org\\n\\nFor additional contact information:\\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\\n     Chief Executive and Director\\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\\n\\n\\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\n\\n\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\nworks.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\n\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\n\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\n\\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.'"
